        </Frame>

        For programmatic access and automation:


        1. Sign in at [github.com](https://github.com/)
        2. Verify your email address, if it hasn't been verified yet.
        3. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  Settings.
        4. In the left sidebar, click  Developer settings.
        5. In the left sidebar, under  Personal access tokens, click Tokens (classic).
        6. Select Generate new token, then click Generate new token (classic):
        <Frame>
			![](/images/screenshots/github_2025-05-02-09-25-29.png)
		</Frame>
        7. In the "Note" field, give your token a descriptive name.
        8. Select Expiration, then choose a default option or click Custom to enter a date.
        9. Select the scopes you'd like to grant this token and Xpander's agents. 
        <Info>
        To read more about the scopes, [click here](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps).
        </Info>
        10. Click Generate token.

        **Note:** After you close this window the token value cannot be retrieved. Save it right awayâ€”preferably in a
        password manager.

### Let's create the Xpander.ai GitHub interface!
<Info>
    Regardless of the specific interface sub-domain (`Search Manager`, `Actions Manager`, `Issues`, or `Pull Requests`), the creation process is the same and described in the following section.
</Info>
        1. Write your interface name.
        2. Select the interface access you'd like.
        3. Select the **API key** authentication method.
        4. Select the **Integration user** authentication scope.
        5. Select **Bearer** as the Auth type.
        6. Paste the token copied earlier in the API Key field using this template: `[YOUR_API_KEY]`, like so:
        <Frame>
			![](/images/screenshots/github_2025-05-02-10-08-42.png)
		</Frame>
        

        Then save the interface.
