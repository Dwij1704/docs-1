    3. Enable the **Google Forms API** in Library
    4. Go to **Credentials** and create an **API Key**
    5. Restrict the API key to Google Forms API only
    6. Copy the API key to xpander.ai's Google Forms connection settings
    7. Set appropriate API access restrictions in Google Cloud Console

    <Warning>
    API keys provide limited functionality and are best for read-only operations on public files. For full access, use OAuth methods.
