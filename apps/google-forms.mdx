    </Frame>

    
    For programmatic access and automation:

    1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
    2. Create a new project or select an existing one
    3. Enable the **Google Forms API** in Library
    4. Go to **Credentials** and create an **API Key**
    5. Restrict the API key to Google Forms API only
    6. Copy the API key to xpander.ai's Google Forms connection settings
    7. Set appropriate API access restrictions in Google Cloud Console

    <Warning>
        API keys provide limited functionality and are best for read-only operations on public files. For full access and to keep your forms private, use OAuth methods.
    </Warning>
