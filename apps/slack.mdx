  For programmatic access and automation you will need a Slack Application.

  If you don't have a Slack Application, start from step 1.  
  If you have a Slack Application, but haven't asked for scopes for the app, skip to step 6.
  If you have a Slack Application, and asked for scopes for the app, skip to step 8.

  1. Go to [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and select **Create New App**.
  2. Select From scratch.
  3. Enter your App Name. For this example, enter "Grocery Reminders".
  4. Select the Workspace where you'll be developing your app. For example, "xpandercommunity". 
      You'll be able to [distribute your app](https://api.slack.com/distribution) to other workspaces later if you choose.
  5. Select **Create App**.
  
  6. Under **OAuth & Permissions**, go to the **Scopes** Section, provide the relevant scopes to the **Bot Token Scopes** which you'd like to add to your app.
  If more info is needed, please continue the scopes creation process via the instructions in [Slack's quickguide](https://api.slack.com/quickstart#scopes).

  7. Under **OAuth Tokens**, click **Install to `<WORKSPACE>`**, and follow the installation process.

  8. Once you have finished installing the app to your workspace, go back to the **OAuth Tokens** section, and copy the **Bot User OAuth Token**:

      **Note:** Make sure to replace `[YOUR_API_KEY]` with your actual Slack API key.

       Then save the interface.
