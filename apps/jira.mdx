    </Frame>

    For programmatic access and automation:


    1. Sign in at
      https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
    2. Click **Create Classic API token**.
    3. Enter a descriptive name.
    4. Select the `Expires on` field, and fill it with an expiry date (between 1–365 days from current date).
    6. Click **Create**.
      <Frame>
        ![](/images/screenshots/jira_2025-04-27-17-46-20.png)
      </Frame>
	  7. Click **Copy to clipboard** and store it somewhere secure.
  
  
    <Warning>
    Tokens that never expire can compromise security, so Atlassian sets a one‑year expiry by default. You can choose any lifetime from 1 to 365 days when you create a token.
    </Warning>

    **Note:** After you close this window the token value cannot be retrieved. Save it right away—preferably in a password manager.

    ### Let's create the Xpander.ai Jira interface!
    Write your interface name, select the interface access you'd like, Select the API key authentication method, and select `Basic` as the Auth type, and paste the token copied earlier in the API Key field, like so:

    <Frame>
      ![](/images/screenshots/jiram_2025-04-27-11-11-08.png)
    </Frame>

    Then save the interface.
