    </Frame>

    For programmatic access and automation:
    
    1. You will need access to the Google Cloud CLI tool in order to get your token. If you have it installed, continue to step 5.
    2. Download [Google Cloud's CLI tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk)
    2. Run the installation script from the directiry where you downloaded and extracted the content of the SDK:
        ```./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh```
    3. After installing the SDK, update your `$PATH` to include the bin folder under the SDK (```export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/Downloads/google-cloud-sdk/bin"```).
    4. To initialize the gcloud CLI, run gcloud init:
        ```./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud init```

    5. Run the following command, and copy the token it generates:
        ```gcloud auth print-access-token```
