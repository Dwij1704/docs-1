    For programmatic access and automation:
    
    1. Sign in to your [Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps) account.
    2. Click on Create new token.
    3. Give the token a suitable name and click on the checkbox of the "I agree to the Asana API Terms" button, and then click Create token.
    4. Copy your personal token, and make sure it's authorized for the relevant workspace you'd like to work with!

    <Warning>
    API keys provide limited functionality and are best for read-only operations on public files. For full access, use OAuth methods.
    </Warning>
    
    ### Let's create the Xpander.ai Asana interface!
    Write your interface name, select the interface access you'd like, Select the API key authentication method, and select `Bearer` as the Auth type, and paste the token copied earlier in the API Key field, like so:    
    <Frame>
		![](/images/screenshots/asana_2025-04-27-10-48-11.png)
	</Frame>

    Then save the interface.
