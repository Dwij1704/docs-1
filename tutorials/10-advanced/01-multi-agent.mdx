# Building Multi-Agent Systems

Learn how to create and orchestrate multiple agents that work together to solve complex tasks.

## Understanding Multi-Agent Architecture

### 1. Agent Roles
- Coordinator agents
- Specialist agents
- Support agents

### 2. Communication Patterns
```javascript
const agentNetwork = {
  coordinator: new XpanderAgent('coordinator'),
  specialists: [
    new XpanderAgent('research'),
    new XpanderAgent('analysis'),
    new XpanderAgent('execution')
  ]
};
```

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Setting Up Agent Communication
- Message passing
- State sharing
- Event handling

### 2. Managing Agent State
- Shared memory
- Individual state
- State synchronization

### 3. Handling Conflicts
- Priority systems
- Conflict resolution
- Fallback mechanisms

## Best Practices
- Design for scalability
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor agent performance
- Maintain system stability

## Advanced Topics
- Dynamic agent creation
- Load balancing
- Fault tolerance
- Performance optimization
