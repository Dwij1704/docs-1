### New API-First Interface Design docs.json

We've introduced a new `docs.json` schema as a replacement for `mint.json`, to support better multi-level versioning, easier visual comprehension, and more consistent terminology. For more information on what's changed, visit our [introduction](/docs/01-get-started/02-introduction).

Upgrade from `mint.json` to `docs.json` with the following steps:

1. Make sure your CLI is the latest version
```bash
npm i xpander@latest -g
```

2. In your docs repository, run:
```bash
xpander upgrade
```

3. Delete your old mint.json file and push your changes

### Configuration File Support

Added support for loading interface configurations from files, making it easier to manage complex setups. Learn more in our [configuration guide](/docs/06-tools/01-add-tools).

```bash
xpander interfaces add agent_123 articles --file ./config.json
```

### CI Checks

Automatically lint your docs to find broken links, discover spelling and grammar issues, or enforce writing styles with your own Vale config. Learn more in our [tools guide](/docs/06-tools/02-create-tool).

### .md support for LLMs

All documentation pages are now automatically available as plain Markdown filesâ€”just append `.md` to the URL. This makes it easier for LLMs to ingest individual pages from your documentation.

### More Themes

New pre-built themes to modify the look & feel of your docs. Configure via your `docs.json` file.

Now available:
- Maple
- Palm

### Enhanced Monitoring

New monitoring capabilities have been added to help track interface performance:

- Real-time calls per day tracking
- Latency monitoring for each endpoint
- Detailed status reporting
