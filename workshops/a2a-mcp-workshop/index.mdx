In this workshop, you'll learn to build custom AI agents using xpander.ai that collaborate through Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols. Using coding agents as a practical example, you'll create agents that work together to handle complex multi-step tasks through intelligent coordination and communication.

When finished, you'll understand how to create custom agents for any domain, implement A2A communication patterns, and build reliable multi-agent systems that can tackle sophisticated challenges.

## The xpander.ai Custom Agent Platform

xpander.ai provides the infrastructure for building custom autonomous agents:

- **Custom Agent Framework** - Build agents for any domain or use case
- **Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)** - Orchestration and communication between agents
- **Local Functions** - Execute custom code and local operations 
- **Unified state management** - Memory objects to make agents stateful with thread support
- **Tool access** - Model Context Protocol (MCP) compatible tool integration
- **Agentic RAG** - Optimize API responses for better agent performance
- **Reliable execution** - Robust engine for tool use and AI calls
- **Human interfaces** - REST API, Web UI, MCP, and webhook support
- **Vault** - Secure key management

## Workshop Focus: Custom Agents with A2A

This workshop teaches you to build custom agents using coding as a concrete example. The principles apply to any domain:

1. **Custom Agent Design** - Design patterns for domain-specific agents
2. **A2A Communication** - How agents coordinate and collaborate
3. **Local Functions** - Execute custom logic and operations locally
4. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Manage complex workflows across agents
5. **Practical Implementation** - Build coding agents as a real-world example

## What You'll Learn

This workshop teaches you:

- **Custom Agent Architecture** - Design patterns for building domain-specific agents
- **A2A vs MCP** - When to use Agent-to-Agent communication vs. tool access protocols
- **Local Functions** - How to execute custom code and operations within agents
- **Multi-Agent Systems** - Orchestration, coordination, and communication patterns
- **Practical Implementation** - Real-world coding agent examples you can adapt

## Key Concepts

### Custom Agents
Learn to build agents tailored for specific domains and use cases:
- Role definition and specialization
- Custom logic and business rules
- Domain-specific tools and capabilities
- Performance optimization for specific tasks

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol
Understand how agents collaborate:
- Coordination and task delegation
- Information sharing between agents
- Conflict resolution and consensus
- Workflow orchestration across multiple agents

### Local Functions
Execute custom operations within agents:
- File system operations
- Database interactions
- API integrations
- Custom business logic

### Coding Agent Example
While the workshop uses coding agents as examples, the patterns apply to any domain:
- Repository management agents
- Code generation specialists
- Quality assurance agents
- Project management coordinators

## Prerequisites

You need:

- AWS account with Amazon Bedrock access
- xpander.ai account
- GitHub account
- Basic understanding of AI agents and APIs
- Programming knowledge (Python/JavaScript helpful)

## Beyond Coding Agents

The patterns you'll learn apply to many domains:

- **Content Creation** - Agents for writing, editing, and publishing
- **Data Analysis** - Agents for processing, analyzing, and reporting
- **Customer Service** - Agents for support, escalation, and resolution
- **Sales & Marketing** - Agents for lead generation, nurturing, and conversion
- **Operations** - Agents for monitoring, alerting, and automation
