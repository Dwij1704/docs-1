# A2A-MCP Agents Workshop

<Frame>
  ![A2A Workshop Banner](/images/workshops/Github.png)
</Frame>

In this workshop, you'll build AI agents with xpander.ai and Amazon Bedrock. You'll create agents that work together to help with coding and development tasks.

When finished, you'll have a GitHub agent in your IDE, two coding agents, and a manager agent that coordinates them. You'll use these agents to build and submit a sample application.

## The xpander.ai Agentic Platform

xpander.ai is open-source multi-framework infrastructure for autonomous agents.

It provides:

- Unified state management (memory object) to make agents stateful, with thread support across frameworks
- Out-of-the-box Agent-to-Agent protocol with orchestration rules between agents.
- Tool access for AI models (Model Context Protocol (MCP) compatible)
- Agentic RAG to optimize API responses.
- Reliable execution engine for tool use and AI calls.
- Dedicated AI workers for hosting custom agents of any framework or AI Model.
- Human interfaces out-of-the-box - REST API, Web UI, MCP, and webhook support included.
- Vault for keys.

## Workshop Modules

1. **GitHub Agent** - Build a GitHub search agent and connect it to your IDE through MCP.
2. **First Coding Agent** - Create a developer agent with Amazon Bedrock that manages repos and writes code.
3. **Second Coding Agent** - Add another developer agent with different capabilities and behavior.
4. **Manager Agent** - Build a coordinator that assigns tasks and manages GitHub pull requests.
5. **Final Project** - Use your agents to build and submit an application.

## What You'll Learn

This workshop teaches you:

- When to use A2A for agent communication vs. MCP for tool access
- How to use Agentic RAG to handle large API responses
- Converting agents from different frameworks to work together
- Adding tools to agents and setting up specific behaviors
- Monitoring agent systems during operation
