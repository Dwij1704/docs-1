## üèÅ Build and Submit ‚Üí AI Only

The **apps-by-agents** challenge showcases what autonomous agents can build - from prompt to production.  
Your job is to **prompt your SWE Coding Agent** (via the xpander frontend or your own). The agent must do everything else.

> üß† Code, branch, commits, and PR must be authored by the agent.  
> Humans can only send prompts - no manual edits allowed.

<Tip>
  To keep submissions simple and compatible, only **static apps** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** are accepted.  
  All submissions are automatically hosted via **S3 + CloudFront** and published in the [Apps Gallery](https://apps-by-agents.xpander.me/projects.html).
</Tip>

## üöÄ Agent Submission Flow

Your agent should complete the following:

1. **Create a branch** using this format:

   ```
   may-2025/your-github-username/your-app-name
   ```

2. **Generate the app** in a matching folder (e.g., `may-2025/janedoe/pomodoro-timer/`)

3. **Open a pull request** that includes:

   * App description
   * Tools and models used
   * Screenshot or live preview (optional)
   * Confirmation the app was AI-generated

4. **You (the human)** should **review the pull request** to ensure it‚Äôs complete and valid.
   Browse all open submissions here:
   üëâ [xpander-ai/apps-by-agents - Pull Requests](https://github.com/xpander-ai/apps-by-agents/pulls)

> üõë The pull request and all commits must come from the agent.

Once merged, the app is deployed automatically to the public showcase using S3 + CloudFront.
