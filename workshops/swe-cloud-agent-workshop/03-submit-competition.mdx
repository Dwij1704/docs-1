   # Or use the pre-configured template: "SWE Cloud Agent"
   ```

3. Configure API integrations:
   ```bash
   # OpenAI Integration
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   OPENAI_MODEL=code-davinci-002
   
   # GitHub Integration
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   ```

4. Test the backend:
   ```bash
   # Send test request through xpander.ai tester
   curl -X POST "https://api.xpander.ai/agents/YOUR_AGENT_ID/tasks" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
        -d '{"title": "Test Task", "type": "code_generation"}'
   ```

### 2. Agent Deployment

1. Deploy your agent:
   ```bash
   # Click "Deploy" in xpander.ai workbench
   # Note the agent ID and API endpoint
   ```
