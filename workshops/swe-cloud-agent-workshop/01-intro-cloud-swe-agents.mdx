<Note>
  In this module, we'll explore the **SWE (Software Engineering) Agent** template on the xpander.ai platform, connect it to GitHub, download the code locally, and test it.
</Note>

**Goal**: Learn how to develop an autonomous coding agent and configure it to work with coding tools such as OpenAI Codex and how it can use different tools

## Step 1: Template Import

To avoid manual configuration work around adding tools, setting instructions, etc., a SWE agent template is ready to be deployed on the platform.
After clicking the Template import button, you will register or log in to xpander.ai and be redirected to the template deployment screen.

    boxShadow: '0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)'
  }}

  Import Codex SWE Agent to your xpander.ai Account
</a>

Follow the import steps as seen in the video:

1. In the agent import wizard, select "New Github Pull Requests interface"
2. The exclamation mark (⚠️) on the Github tools indicates that the Connector for Github has not been authorized yet. Click on one of them to see the connector settings.
3. In the popup window, connect to Github with OAuth2.

</Frame>

You are now seeing the AI Workbench - a user interface used to design, deploy, test and observe agents.

<Tip>
  The left side of the AI Workbench can be used to easily interact with your agent and see how it behaves in real time - we will do that in a minute.
</Tip>

Change the view to **Agent Graph** to see the visual representation of your agent or multi-agent team, including its different triggering capabilities and its available tools.

Check out the available tools your agent has. It can interact with GitHub - listing, creating, updating, and commenting on pull requests. More importantly, it can code using the built-in Coding agent, built on an enhanced version of Codex CLI.

<Accordion title="Red exclamation mark on Github tools?">


<Warning>If the Github tools on the graph are displaying a red exclamation mark, it's because you still need to authorize the Github connector. Click on the exclamation mark and go through the Auth process with OAuth2</Warning>

<Accordion title="Codex CLI built into the agent?">

  The **Coding Agent** runs on **GPT-4.1** and handles high-level reasoning, task planning, and decision-making.  
  It uses tools to complete actions - one of them being the **Codex tool**.

  The **Codex tool** is a containerized, sandboxed version of the **Codex CLI**, running with the agent’s own **Git credentials**.  
  It's powered by the **codex-mini-latest** model, optimized for fast, focused code generation.

  The agent sends coding tasks to this tool - for example, “add tests for this function” - and the Codex tool writes or modifies the code.  
  Combined with the **GitHub integration**, the agent can autonomously list, create, update, and comment on pull requests.

</Accordion>

## Step 2: Test your agent using the visual AI Workbench

Let’s walk through a real GitHub workflow using your agent. We'll use the `xpander-ai/apps-by-agents` repository and test out some core capabilities.

---
### Test 1: The agent's capabilities

In the left tab of the AI Workbench (Tester tab), submit this prompt:

```text
What can you do ?
```

<Frame>
![Step 1 capabilities](/images/workshops/swe-capabilities.png)

---

### Test 2: List Pull Requests

In the left tab of the AI Workbench (Tester tab), submit this prompt:

```text
List all pull requests (open or closed) in "xpander-ai/apps-by-agents"
```


<Tip>
Change the view to **Full View** and expand the API calls to see the generated parameters from the AI model to the different APIs and the payload returned to the AI model.
</Tip>

### Test 3: Summarize the Latest PR

```text
In xpander-ai/apps-by-agents, explain the most recent pull request and what the code changes do.
```

<Tip>
Click on "Channels" and go to "Chat" and open Markdown rich Web Interface built-in for your agent
</Tip>

## Step 3: Load the agent locally


Run the CLI to get your agent

```bash
xpander login
```

![xpander-login screenshot](/images/workshops/xpander-login.png)

You can now pull a list of the agents with 

```bash
xpander agent list
```

Click on the URL of the agent, and click on the CLI icon at the top left, and run
```
xpander agent init <agent-id>
```

![xpander-agent-init](/images/xpander-agent-init.png)

## Step 4: Run the agent locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run `python myAgent.py`

```log
❯ python myAgent.py

Next, run `python xpander_handler.py` to register your machine to receive events to the agent

<Check>
We now have the backend ready. The UI can help us control the agent tools, the model, the events that are coming, the authentication, and all the infrastructure needed for the agent.

##  What's Next?

Your Coding Agent is now live and connected - it can generate code with Codex and interact with GitHub.

→ Proceed to [Module 2: Frontend Build & Testing](./02-load-backend-template) to connect a minimal OpenAI Codex-style UI to interact with your agent, track its tasks, etc.
