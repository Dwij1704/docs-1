  **Module Summary**

  - **Goal**: Set up xpander.ai access and import coding agent template
  - **Estimated Time**: 10-15 minutes
  - **Prerequisites**: xpander.ai account, basic agent concepts
</Note>

## Quick Setup

### 1. Template Import

<Info>
  The **Coding Agent** runs on **GPT-4.1** and handles high-level reasoning, task planning, and decision-making.  
  It uses tools to complete actions — one of them being the **Codex tool**.

  The **Codex tool** is a containerized, sandboxed version of the **Codex CLI**, running with the agent’s own **Git credentials**.  
  It's powered by the **codex-mini-latest** model, optimized for fast, focused code generation.

  The agent sends coding tasks to this tool — for example, “add tests for this function” — and the Codex tool writes or modifies the code.  
  Combined with the **GitHub integration**, the agent can autonomously list, create, update, and comment on pull requests.
</Info>

### 2. 🧠 Your Coding Agent

You are now seeing the AI Workbench - a user interface used to design, deploy, test and observe agents. 

<Info>
  The **AI Workbench** is designed to help you quickly test and iterate on AI agents using different LLM models and toolchains.  
  In this module, we'll test the **SWE (Software Engineering) Agent** using **GPT-4.1 & Codex**, exploring its ability to reason, interact with GitHub, and execute code-related tasks in a real environment.
</Info>

<Tip>
  The left side of the AI Workbench can be used to easily intract with your agent and see how it behaves in real time - we will do that in a minute.

  The right side is a visual representation of your agent or multi-agent team, including its different triggering capabilities and its available tools.
</Tip>

Check out the available tools your agent has. It can interact with GitHub - listing, creating, updating, and commenting on pull requests. More importantly, it can code using the built-in Coding agent, built on an enhanced version of Codex CLI.

<Info>The Github tools on the graph are displaying a red exclemation mark, becuase you still need to authorize the Github connector. Click on the exclamation mark and go through the Auth process with Oauth2</Info>

### 🔐 Authorize GitHub Access

Click the exclamation mark on any GitHub-related node in your agent’s graph.  
A popup will appear prompting you to authorize GitHub via OAuth — this allows the agent to interact with your repositories.

### 3. 🚗 Test Drive Your Agent

Let’s walk through a real GitHub workflow using your agent. We'll use the `xpander-ai/apps-by-agents` repository and test out some core capabilities.

---

#### 🪄 Step 1: List Pull Requests

Ask your agent:

```text
List all pull requests (open or closed) in "xpander-ai/apps-by-agents"
```

![Step 1 PR List](/images/workshops/list-prs.png)

---

#### 🧠 Step 2: Summarize the Latest PR

Then ask:

```text
Explain the most recent pull request and what the code changes do.
```

## ✅ What's Next?

Your Coding Agent is now live and connected — it can reason with GPT-4.1, generate code with Codex, and interact with GitHub.

→ Proceed to [Module 2: Frontend Build & Testing](./02-load-backend-template) to connect a minimal OpenAI Codex-style UI and interact with your agent in real time.
