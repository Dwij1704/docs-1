description: "Use a lightweight ChatGPT-Codex style UI to submit a coding task to your SWE agent"
icon: "desktop"
---

<Note>
In this module, we deploy a custom UI that is similar to the capabilities you get with ChatGPT-Codex. Then, we submit a coding task to the SWE agent.

  - **Goal**: Clone a minimal ChatGPT-Codex style frontend and connect it to to the agent your deployed in the previous module.
</Note>

## Use-case

Many times, AI Agents running on a Backend-as-a-Service platform are a part of a wider application. In this case, our AI agent is already available, and we'd like to hook it up to a task management system. The task management system in this module is not a part of the xpander.ai platform, and it's simply used for demonstration purposes.


## Clone the frontend example app

We‚Äôll start by cloning and installing the prebuilt UI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xpander-ai/coding-agent-frontend-example-app.git
cd coding-agent-frontend-example-app
npm install
```

![Step 1 - Clone and Install](/images/workshops/git-clone.png)

## Configure environment variables

Copy the example .env file and populate it

```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

Fill in the following:

```env
# API Key - Available in xpander.ai UI from Settings -> API keys 
VITE_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# Agent ID - Available in xpander.ai UI from the Workbench -> SDK node at the top of the canvas
VITE_APP_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id_here
# Organization ID - Available in xpander.ai UI from Settings -> API keys
VITE_APP_ORGANIZATION_ID=your_organization_id_here
```

## Start the App

Launch the demo app locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

![Step 3 - npm run dev](/images/workshops/swe-npm-run-dev.png)

Then navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Send your first coding task
Your local task management demo app is now connected to the SWE agent you deployed in the last module. Let's start using it.

In the input field, submit one of the example prompts below
feel free to be creative, just make sure the target repo (to https://github.com/xpander-ai/apps-by-agents)

<Accordion title="Prompt Examples for apps-by-agents">

<Note>
We are pushing the results of the coding task to a repo called xpander-ai/apps-by-agents - this repo is used in the workshop to host apps that are developed by SWE agents.

## Track task execution

Click **View codex logs** to view real-time execution details and explore the logs.
Pay attention of the way codex manage and run the agentic loop and the creation process of your app.

> ‚è≥ **Note**: Task execution takes a few minutes - sit back, relax, and watch the agent work its magic.

  <video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="https://assets.xpanderai.io/workshops/videos/swe-track-result.mp4" />
</Frame>

### You‚Äôll see:

- **Top**: The original prompt or task
- **Popup**: Logs and generated output from the agent
- **Result**: Execution result
- **Logs & Messages Buttons**: Execution messages logs & codex execution logs

<Accordion title="How does this work?">

  When you submit a task, the app uses the **xpander.ai SDK** (via a **Web Worker**) to create and run the task in the cloud - fully serverless.

  The worker handles:
  - Creating tasks ‚Üí [`createTask()` in `workers/xpanderWorker.ts`](https://github.com/xpander-ai/coding-agent-frontend-example-app/blob/main/src/workers/xpanderWorker.ts#L79)
  - Fetching task details and logs ‚Üí [`useTask()` and `useLogs()` in `hooks/`](https://github.com/xpander-ai/coding-agent-frontend-example-app/tree/main/src/hooks)

  The UI polls task status and updates in real time using **React Query**.  
  You can see this in action inside:
  - [`Dashboard`](https://github.com/xpander-ai/coding-agent-frontend-example-app/blob/main/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx): task list and creation
  - [`TaskDetails`](https://github.com/xpander-ai/coding-agent-frontend-example-app/blob/main/src/pages/TaskDetails.tsx): real-time updates, logs, messages

  The **Codex tool** streams logs to a centralized **Logstash** tied to your **account**.  
  Logs are stored for a limited period and made available via the `logs.xpander.ai` micro-service.

  The frontend fetches these logs through polling (every 2s) using the SDK inside a Web Worker.

  üí° A task can include multiple threads - each representing a conversation or execution chain tied to your agent.

### Succesful app creation

## Summary and next steps

Your SWE task management UI is now live and connected to the SWE agent hosted on xpander.ai.
Through the UI, you instructed the agent to build an application and push it to the apps-by-agents repo.
