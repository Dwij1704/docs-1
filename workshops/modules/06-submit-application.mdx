# Module 6: Final Push — Submit Your Application

In this final module, you'll complete your application, finalize the codebase, and prepare a submission that showcases how your agent fleet worked together to build a functional product.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Ensure your application is complete and functional
- Prepare a clean, well-documented codebase
- Submit your project to the workshop repository
- Create a demonstration of your agent fleet's capabilities

## Steps

### 1. Perform Final Code Review

Use your Manager Agent to conduct a comprehensive review of the codebase:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd project

# Request a comprehensive code review from the manager agent
curl -X POST https://your-deployed-serverless-url.amazonaws.com/task \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "comprehensive_review",
    "repository": "https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git",
    "branch": "main"
  }'
```

Review the results and address any outstanding issues.

### 2. Finalize Documentation

Ensure your project has comprehensive documentation:

```bash
# Request documentation generation from the agent fleet
curl -X POST https://your-deployed-serverless-url.amazonaws.com/task \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "generate_documentation",
    "repository": "https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git",
    "items": ["README", "API", "ARCHITECTURE", "USAGE"]
  }'
```

The documentation should include:
- A detailed README.md
- Installation and setup instructions
- API documentation (if applicable)
- Architecture overview
- Usage examples

### 3. Create a Project Demo

Prepare a demonstration of your project:

```bash
# Generate a demo script using the manager agent
curl -X POST https://your-deployed-serverless-url.amazonaws.com/task \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "create_demo",
    "repository": "https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git",
    "demoType": "walkthrough"
  }'
```

Your demo should showcase:
- What your application does
- How users can interact with it
- Key features and capabilities
- How the agent fleet collaborated to build it

### 4. Document the Agent Collaboration Process

Create a document that outlines how your agents worked together:

```bash
cat > AGENT_COLLABORATION.md << EOF
# Agent Fleet Collaboration

## Fleet Structure
- Agent 1 (CodeExpert): [Describe role and responsibilities]
- Agent 2 (CodeCreative): [Describe role and responsibilities]
- Manager Agent: [Describe role and responsibilities]

## Collaboration Workflow
[Describe how the agents worked together]

## Key Decisions
[Highlight important decisions made during development]

## Challenges and Solutions
[Discuss any challenges faced and how they were resolved]

## Lessons Learned
[Share insights gained from this experiment]
EOF
```

### 5. Submit to Workshop Repository

Submit your project to the Xpander.ai Workshop GitHub Repository:

```bash
# Fork the workshop repository
gh repo fork xpander-ai/a2a-bedrock-workshop

# Clone the forked repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/a2a-bedrock-workshop.git
cd a2a-bedrock-workshop

# Create a directory for your submission
mkdir -p submissions/yourusername

# Create your submission README
cat > submissions/yourusername/README.md << EOF
# [Your Project Name] by [Your Name]

## Project Description
[Brief description of your project]

## Repository
[Link to your project repository]

## Demo
[Link to demo or instructions to run it]

## Agent Fleet
[Brief description of your agent fleet structure]

## Highlights
- [Interesting feature or implementation detail]
- [Another interesting aspect]
- [Something else worth noting]
EOF

# Add a link to your project
git add submissions/yourusername/README.md
git commit -m "Add submission for [Your Name]"
git push origin main

# Create a pull request
gh pr create --title "Submission: [Your Project Name] by [Your Name]" --body "My workshop project submission" --repo xpander-ai/a2a-bedrock-workshop
```

### 6. Prepare a Short Presentation

Create a 5-minute presentation about your project:

1. Introduction (30 seconds)
   - Who you are
   - What you built

2. Application Overview (1 minute)
   - What the application does
   - Key features

3. Agent Fleet Demonstration (2 minutes)
   - Show how the agents worked together
   - Highlight interesting interactions

4. Code Walkthrough (1 minute)
   - Show key parts of the code
   - Explain how the agents generated it

5. Conclusions (30 seconds)
   - What you learned
   - Future improvements

## Verification

Before submitting, verify that:

1. Your application is fully functional
2. All code is properly committed to the repository
3. Documentation is complete and clear
4. Your submission to the workshop repository is properly formatted
5. Your presentation covers all the required elements

## Goal

✅ By the end of this module, you will have a complete, well-documented, agent-built application submitted to the workshop repository, with a clear demonstration of how your agent fleet collaborated to build it.
