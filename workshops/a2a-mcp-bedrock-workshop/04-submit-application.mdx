<Note>
**Module Summary**
* **Goal**: Build an application with your agent fleet and submit it to the workshop repository
* **Estimated Time**: 10-20 minutes
* **Prerequisites**: Manager agent with MCP and GitHub PR capabilities
</Note>

In this final module, you'll activate your agent fleet to collaboratively build an application of your choice and submit it to the xpander.ai repository. This is where your preparation in the previous modules comes together!

## üöÄ Vibe Coding with Your Agent Fleet

Now that you have:
- Built two developer agents with different models
- Created a manager agent that can orchestrate them
- Connected your manager to Cursor IDE via MCP
- Added PR capabilities to your manager

It's time to let your agents build something practical! This approach, which we call "Vibe Coding," lets you express your creative ideas while your agents handle the technical implementation.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Submit Your Request via MCP

Using Cursor with MCP enabled, simply ask your manager agent to build the application you want. Be specific about functionality you need:

```
Build a personal portfolio website with a clean, modern design that showcases projects and skills.
```

```
Create a weather dashboard that shows forecasts for multiple cities with beautiful visualizations.
```

```
Develop a markdown note-taking app with tags and search functionality.
```

<Note>
Your manager agent will coordinate the work between your two developer agents, review their code, and select the best implementation. This all happens automatically thanks to the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) capabilities you configured.
</Note>

## üìä Monitor Your Agents' Activity

While your agents are working, you can track their progress:

1. Go to [https://app.xpander.ai](https://app.xpander.ai)
2. Navigate to the **Activity** tab
3. Watch as your agents collaborate, write code, and solve problems

## üöÄ Automatic PR Creation

Once your agents have built the application, ask your manager agent to submit the code to the xpander.ai repository:

```
Submit my [weather dashboard/portfolio website/markdown note app] application to the xpander-ai/apps-by-agents repository. Create a PR to the 'agents' branch using the following structure:
1. Fork the repository if needed
2. Create a folder named YYYY-MM-DD@[my-app-name] at the root level
3. Add all application files and a detailed README.md
4. Create a PR with the title "Workshop Submission: [My App Name]" and mention which models were used
```

Your manager agent will:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create the appropriate folder structure
3. Add your application code
4. Create a README file
5. Submit a pull request to the agents branch

<Tip>
The repository structure should follow this pattern using ISO date format:
```
--root
----YYYY-MM-DD@your-application-name
------your-generated-app
```
</Tip>

## üèÜ See What Everyone Built!

At the end of the workshop, we'll showcase all the applications created by participants and their agent fleets. This is a great opportunity to:

- See different approaches to agent orchestration
- Explore creative applications built by AI agents
- Get inspired for your next AI agent project

## ‚úÖ Checkpoint

By completing this module, you should now be able to:

1. Use MCP to communicate with your manager agent through Cursor
2. Have your manager coordinate your developer agents to build an application
3. Monitor agent activity and collaboration in real-time
4. Create a GitHub PR with your application automatically
5. Submit your creation to the workshop repository

## üéì Workshop Completion

Congratulations! By completing all four modules, you've:

1. Built your first developer agent
2. Expanded your agent fleet with different models and capabilities
3. Created a manager agent to orchestrate your development process
4. Used your agent fleet to build and submit a real application

You now have a powerful understanding of how to build and deploy AI agent systems using xpander.ai's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) framework, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and Amazon Bedrock.
