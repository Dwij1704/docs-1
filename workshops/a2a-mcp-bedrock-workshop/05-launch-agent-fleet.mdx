title: "Module 5: Vibe Coding — Launch Your Agent Fleet"
description: "Activate your full agent fleet to collaboratively build a complete application"
icon: "rocket-launch"
---

In this module, you'll bring together all the components created in previous modules to launch a collaborative agent fleet that can build a complete application through natural language interactions. This represents the culmination of your agent architecture.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Activate your full agent fleet
- Coordinate multiple agents to work on a single project
- Implement complete development workflows from ideation to PR
- Build a real application using your agent fleet

## Steps

### 1. Prepare the Agent Fleet

First, ensure all your agents are ready to work together:

```bash
# Start the local coding agents
cd agent-1
npm start &

cd ../agent-2
npm start &

# Ensure your serverless manager agent is deployed and running
# Note: This should already be running from Module 4
```

### 2. Choose Your Project

Select the type of application you want to build. Here are some ideas:

- **Web App**: A simple web application with frontend and backend components
- **CLI Tool**: A command-line utility to solve a specific problem
- **Chat Bot**: A conversational agent for a specific domain
- **Data Processing Tool**: An application to transform or analyze data
- **API Service**: A microservice providing specific functionality

Document your project idea:

```bash
mkdir project
cd project

# Create a project specification
cat > project-spec.md << EOF
# Project: [Your Project Name]

## Overview
[Brief description of what the application will do]

## Features
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]

## Technology Stack
- [Technology 1]
- [Technology 2]
- [Technology 3]

## Development Milestones
1. [Milestone 1]
2. [Milestone 2]
3. [Milestone 3]
EOF
```

### 3. Set Up the Project Repository

Initialize a new Git repository for your project:

```bash
# Initialize the repository
git init
git add project-spec.md
git commit -m "Initial project specification"

# Create a GitHub repository (if you haven't already)
# Replace with your GitHub username and desired repo name
gh repo create yourusername/project-name --public -y
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Configure the Fleet for Your Project

Create a fleet configuration file:

```bash
cat > fleet-config.json << EOF
{
  "project": {
    "name": "Your Project Name",
    "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git",
    "localPath": "$(pwd)"
  },
  "agents": {
    "codeExpert": {
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:3001",
      "responsibilities": ["backend", "infrastructure", "optimization"]
    },
    "codeCreative": {
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:3002",
      "responsibilities": ["frontend", "design", "user experience"]
    },
    "manager": {
      "endpoint": "https://your-deployed-serverless-url.amazonaws.com",
      "responsibilities": ["planning", "review", "coordination"]
    }
  },
  "workflow": {
    "ideation": "manager",
    "planning": "manager",
    "implementation": ["codeExpert", "codeCreative"],
    "review": "manager",
    "deployment": "manager"
  }
}
EOF
```

### 5. Launch the Project Development

Now, it's time to start the development process using your agent fleet:

```bash
# Send the initial task to the manager agent via MCP
curl -X POST https://your-deployed-serverless-url.amazonaws.com/task \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "start_project",
    "project": {
      "name": "Your Project Name",
      "specification": "$(cat project-spec.md | base64)",
      "repository": "https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git"
    },
    "fleetConfig": $(cat fleet-config.json)
  }'
```

### 6. Monitor and Interact with the Agent Fleet

Watch your agents work and interact with them as needed:

- Monitor the logs of each agent to see their activities
- Check the project repository for new branches and commits
- Review Pull Requests generated by the manager agent
- Provide additional guidance or clarification through the MCP interface

### 7. Review the Development Process

As your agents work on the project, observe and document how they:

- Break down tasks based on the project specification
- Allocate work between specialized agents
- Commit code to feature branches
- Submit and review Pull Requests
- Iteratively improve the application

## Verification

To ensure your agent fleet is functioning properly:

1. Check that all agents are active and communicating
2. Verify that code is being generated for the specified features
3. Monitor branch creation and commit patterns
4. Review Pull Requests to ensure they follow best practices
5. Test the application functionality as it develops

## Goal

✅ By the end of this module, your agent fleet should be autonomously developing a real application, handling the entire lifecycle from ideation through code generation, commits, and Pull Requests.
