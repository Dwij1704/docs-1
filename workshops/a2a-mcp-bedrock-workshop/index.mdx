## Workshop Objectives

This workshop will guide you through creating a complete AI agent ecosystem that can:

- Perform collaborative development with specialized developer agents
- Improve development efficiency through agent coordination
- Generate functional code from natural language instructions
- Automate code review and pull request processes
- Deploy agent-built applications

  >
    Create your first AI developer agent powered by Amazon Bedrock. You'll set up a local environment, configure agent instructions, connect it to the cloud, and implement repository management capabilities including cloning repositories and file creation.

  >
    Develop specialized developer agents with different capabilities using various LLM models. You'll create agents with distinct roles and expertise, establishing the foundation for parallel development that leverages the strengths of different AI models.

    color="#9B70FF"
  >
    Create a manager agent to orchestrate your developer agents. Using xpander.ai's Workbench, you'll develop a central coordinator that delegates tasks to your developer agents, manages GitHub operations, and connects to your Cursor IDE through MCP.
