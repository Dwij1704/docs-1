## Workshop Objectives

This workshop will guide you through creating a complete AI agent ecosystem that can:

- Perform collaborative development with specialized developer agents
- Improve development efficiency through agent coordination
- Generate functional code from natural language instructions
- Automate code review and pull request processes
- Deploy agent-built applications

  >
    Develop specialized developer agents with different capabilities using various LLM models. You'll create agents with distinct roles and expertise, establishing the foundation for parallel development that leverages the strengths of different AI models.

    color="#9B70FF"
  >
    Create a manager agent to orchestrate your developer agents. Using xpander.ai's Workbench, you'll develop a central coordinator that delegates tasks to your developer agents, manages GitHub operations, and connects to your Cursor IDE through MCP.

  >
    Apply your agent fleet to build a functional application from a simple prompt. Your manager agent will coordinate the developer agents to implement your requirements, then submit the completed project to the xpander.ai repository for demonstration.
