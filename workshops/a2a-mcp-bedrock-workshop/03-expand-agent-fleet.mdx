<Note>
**Module Summary**
* **Goal**: Create specialized developer agents with different LLM models and personalities
* **Estimated Time**: 10-20 minutes
* **Prerequisites**: Completion of Module 2, access to AWS Bedrock
</Note>

🚀  In this module, you'll duplicate your existing agent setup, customize it with new instructions, configure it to use Llama 4, and deploy it to the cloud. By the end, you'll have two independent agents with different capabilities that you can compare and contrast!

## 🔄 Duplicate Your Agent Setup

First, let's create a copy of your first agent to build upon:

```bash
# Navigate back to your workshop directory
cd ..

# Create a new directory for your second agent
mkdir dev-agent-2

# Copy the agent files, excluding the virtual environment
cp -r dev-agent-1/agent_instructions.json dev-agent-1/coding_agent.py dev-agent-1/main.py dev-agent-1/local_tools.py dev-agent-1/requirements.txt dev-agent-1/xpander_handler.py dev-agent-1/sandbox.py dev-agent-1/.env dev-agent-2/ 

# Change to the new directory
cd dev-agent-2

# Open in Cursor
cursor .
```

Open the Cursor terminal and create a fresh virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<Warning>
  Never copy the `.venv` directory between projects. Always create a fresh virtual environment for each agent to avoid dependency conflicts and ensure a clean installation.
</Warning>

## ✏️ Create Different Agent Instructions

Edit the `agent_instructions.json` file to give your new agent a different personality and focus (you can also ask Cursor to help with this):

```json
{
  "role": "Experimental Code Explorer and Innovator",
  "goal": "Help users explore creative coding approaches, generate experimental prototypes, and implement innovative solutions that push boundaries",
  "general": "You are a coding agent specializing in creative and experimental approaches to software development. Follow these guidelines when assisting users:\n\n1. Ideation and Exploration:\n   - Suggest multiple possible approaches to problems\n   - Embrace experimental technologies and techniques\n   - Help users explore the bleeding edge of development\n\n2. Creative Implementation:\n   - Generate code that demonstrates novel approaches\n   - Balance innovation with practicality\n   - Provide clear explanations of experimental techniques\n\n3. Rapid Prototyping:\n   - Focus on quick, functional prototypes over perfect code\n   - Use modern frameworks and libraries that accelerate development\n   - Encourage iterative development and testing\n\n4. Risk Assessment:\n   - Clearly identify experimental features and their potential risks\n   - Suggest fallback approaches when appropriate\n   - Highlight areas where established patterns might be more suitable\n\n5. Learning Encouragement:\n   - Explain the rationale behind innovative approaches\n   - Point users to resources for emerging technologies\n   - Foster a mindset of curiosity and continuous learning\n\nAs an experimental coding agent, prioritize creativity and innovation while still delivering functional solutions."
}
```

## 🔧 Configure for Llama Model

Now, let's create a new agent using the xpander CLI:

```bash
xpander agent new
```

You'll see the agent creation wizard:

```bash
❯ xpander agent new

? What name would you like for your agent? dev-agent-2
⠋ Creating agent "dev-agent-2"...Creating agent in organization: 8d185373-8b24-47a7-8607-3e9036b968bb...
✔ Agent "dev-agent-2" created successfully!


🚀 Your Agent is Ready!

✅ Agent creation complete!

? Do you want to load this agent into your current workdir? Yes

✨ Initializing agent

ℹ Agent dev-agent-2 retrieved successfully
? The current directory is not empty. Proceeding will override 'requirements.txt' and add or update 
xpander-related files (xpander_config.json, agent_instructions.json, etc). Yes

✔ Agent initialized successfully
```

Next, you need to edit the `coding_agent.py` file to use the Llama model.

Find and replace the model ID with the Llama 4 model:

```python
MODEL_ID = "us.meta.llama4-maverick-17b-instruct-v1:0"
```

## 🧪 Test Your Second Agent Locally

Just like with your first agent, you can test this one locally:

```bash
python main.py
```

<Note>
  The Llama model has different strengths compared to Claude. You may notice differences in how it approaches problems, the style of code it generates, and its explanations.
</Note>

Verify that the handler is working correctly by running `python xpander_handler.py` and sending a message from the UI. 

Once you've confirmed that the agent is accepting events, you're ready to deploy it to the cloud.

## 🚀 Deploy to the Cloud

Deploy your second agent to the cloud:

```bash
xpander deploy
```

Now that you have two agents ready for your commands, the next step is to build a manager for them!

Let's move forward to the [next module](/workshops/a2a-mcp-bedrock-workshop/04-serverless-manager-agent) where we'll create a manager agent to coordinate your agent fleet.
