In this module, you'll create a manager agent using the xpander.ai platform. This agent will orchestrate your coding agents, bringing centralized control to your agent ecosystem.

🚀 You'll use the visual Agent Workbench to design your manager agent, configure it to coordinate your existing agents, test it in the platform, and connect it to your development workflow!

## 🔧 Access the xpander.ai Workbench

First, let's access the xpander.ai platform to create your manager agent:

1. Go to [https://app.xpander.ai](https://app.xpander.ai) and sign in with your credentials
2. In the left navigation menu, go to **AI Agents**
3. Click the **New AI Agent** button to open the Workbench

## 🔄 Configure Agent Team Structure

Next, you'll need to set up your agent team with the proper structure:

1. Click on the **Agent Teams** tab in the navigation bar
2. Click the **Create AI Agents Team** button
3. Name your team "Coding Fleet"
4. Add both of your coding agents to the team:
   - Click the "Add Agent" button
   - Select dev-agent-1 and dev-agent-2 from the dropdown
   - Click "Done"
5. Configure the team layout:
   - Click the "Builder" tab to access the visual canvas
   - Change the layout type from "Router" to "Manager" in the Delegation settings
   - Select your new manager agent as the manager
   - Verify the connections between the manager and the coding agents

## 📝 Customize Manager Instructions

Your manager agent needs clear instructions on how to coordinate the team:

1. Return to the AI Agents section and select your manager agent
2. Click on the "Instructions" tab
3. Customize the instructions with the following:

```json
{
  "role": "Development Team Coordinator",
  "goal": "Coordinate coding agents by assigning tasks based on their specialties and aggregating their results to provide complete solutions",
  "general": "You are a specialized manager agent responsible for coordinating a team of coding agents. Follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Task Analysis:\n   - Analyze incoming user requests to determine required coding tasks\n   - Break complex requests into smaller, manageable subtasks\n   - Identify which agent would be best suited for each subtask\n\n2. Agent Selection:\n   - dev-agent-1 (Claude): Specializes in precise, validated code development\n   - dev-agent-2 (Llama): Focuses on creative and experimental approaches\n\n3. Task Delegation:\n   - Assign tasks to appropriate agents based on their specialties\n   - Provide clear instructions and context for each subtask\n   - Include relevant details and requirements\n\n4. Result Aggregation:\n   - Collect outputs from all agents\n   - Combine results into a cohesive solution\n   - Ensure consistency across different agents' contributions\n   - Format the final response for clarity\n\n5. Conflict Resolution:\n   - If agents provide conflicting approaches, evaluate trade-offs\n   - Make final decisions based on user requirements\n   - Explain reasoning for chosen solutions\n\nPrioritize efficient coordination while ensuring high-quality outputs that leverage each agent's strengths."
}
```

## 🧪 Test Your Manager Agent

Now it's time to test your manager agent's ability to coordinate your coding agents:

1. In the Workbench, use the Agent Tester (left pane) to test your manager agent
2. Enter a test prompt that requires coordination, such as:

```
Create a weather data visualization application. I need both a reliable backend API and an innovative frontend.
```

3. Watch as your manager agent:
   - Analyzes the task
   - Breaks it down into subtasks
   - Delegates to the appropriate coding agents
   - Aggregates the results

## 🚀 Deploy Your Manager Agent

Deploy your manager agent to make it available for use:

1. Click the **Deploy** button in the Workbench
2. Once deployment is complete, your manager agent will be available via the API and other interfaces

<Tip>
  You can monitor your manager agent's activity in the Activity tab, where you'll see all interactions and delegations to your coding agents.
</Tip>

## 🔄 Connect to Your Development Workflow

Your manager agent can now be used in your development workflow through multiple interfaces:

### Chat Interface

The simplest way to interact with your manager agent is through the built-in chat interface:

1. From the AI Agents list, click on your manager agent
2. Select the "Chat" tab
3. Start sending requests that require coordination between your coding agents

### SDK Integration

For programmatic access, integrate your manager agent into your workflow using the xpander SDK:

```python
from xpander_sdk import XpanderClient
import os

# Initialize client
xpander_client = XpanderClient(api_key=os.environ["XPANDER_API_KEY"])

# Load your manager agent
manager_agent = xpander_client.agents.get(agent_id="your-manager-agent-id")

# Create a task for the manager
manager_agent.add_task("""
Create a user authentication system with a secure backend and an intuitive frontend.
""")

# Run the manager agent
while not manager_agent.is_finished():
    # The manager will automatically coordinate with your coding agents
    # through the team configuration you set up
    manager_agent.agent_loop_step()

# Get the final aggregated result
result = manager_agent.retrieve_execution_result()
print(result.result)
```

## 🔍 Understanding Manager Delegation

The manager agent follows a structured decision process when coordinating your coding agents:

1. **Task Analysis**: The manager evaluates the incoming request to understand requirements
2. **Task Decomposition**: Complex tasks are broken down into smaller, manageable subtasks
3. **Agent Selection**: The manager determines which coding agent is best suited for each subtask
4. **Delegation**: Tasks are assigned to appropriate agents with clear instructions
5. **Result Collection**: The manager collects outputs from all agents
6. **Result Aggregation**: The manager combines all outputs into a cohesive solution
7. **Quality Assurance**: The manager reviews the combined solution for consistency and completeness

This process happens automatically through the team configuration you've set up in the platform.

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now that you have a complete fleet with a manager agent coordinating your specialized coding agents, you're ready to tackle complex development tasks more efficiently!
