<Frame>![Completed Agent](/images/screenshots/2025-05-03-23-42-23.png)</Frame>

## üß™ Testing Your Agent with Raw API Responses

Let's test your newly created GitHub search agent:

1. In the left pane of the builder interface, you'll find the testing area
2. Type the following query to search for topics:
   ```txt Prompt
   Search for topics in GitHub related to A2A and MCP
   ```

3. Look at the generated payload by clicking on it. You'll see something like:
   ```json Example AI Generated Payload
   {
      "bodyParams": {},
      "queryParams": {
         "q": "A2A MCP",
         "per-page": 10,
         "page": 1
      },
      "pathParams": {}
   }
   ```

   ```json Example response
   {
    "total_count": 2,
    "incomplete_results": false,
    "items": [
        {
            "name": "a2a-mcp",
            "created_at": "2025-04-30T00:52:27Z",
            "updated_at": "2025-04-30T00:52:27Z",
            "featured": false,
            "curated": false,
            "score": 1
        },
        {
            "name": "a2a-vs-mcp",
            "created_at": "2025-04-30T00:52:27Z",
            "updated_at": "2025-04-30T00:52:27Z",
            "featured": false,
            "curated": false,
            "score": 1
        }
    ]
   }
   ```

4. Now try a repositories search in the testing area:
   ```txt Prompt
   Find cool repositories related to Agent 2 Agent and MCP
   ```

<Warning>
Notice that the API response is huge and not optimal for AI consumption! This is where Agentic RAG comes in to help filter and optimize these responses.
</Warning>

## üß† Optimizing Responses with Agentic RAG

### Optimizing Repository Search

Let's improve the repository search results using Agentic RAG:

1. Return to the **Builder** tab
2. Click on the gear icon next to the **Find Repositories by Criteria** operation
3. Click on **Advanced** and then switch to **Raw Editor** (this allows the AI to send natural language queries, and the server will perform semantic search on the API response)
4. Configure the search and return fields:

   Searchable Fields (fields the AI can search against):
   ```json Searchable Fields Configuration
   [
     "items[].full_name",
     "items[].description",
     "items[].topics"
   ]
   ```

   Returnable Fields (data the AI will receive):
   ```json Returnable Fields Configuration
   [
     "items[].html_url",
     "items[].full_name",
     "items[].description"
   ]
   ```

   <Frame>![Agentic RAG Configuration](/images/screenshots/2025-05-03-22-48-39.png)</Frame>

6. Save your changes
7. Return to the **Tester** tab and run the repositories query again:
   ```txt Prompt
   Find 2-3 cool repositories related to Agent 2 Agent and MCP
   ```

<Tip>
Notice how much cleaner and more focused the response is now! Instead of overwhelming JSON data, you get just the meaningful content that matters to your query.
</Tip>

### Optimizing User Search

Next, let's optimize the user search operation:

1. Return to the **Builder** tab
2. Click on the gear icon next to the **Find Users by Criteria** operation
3. Go to **Advanced** ‚Üí **Raw Editor**
4. Configure the fields:

   Searchable Fields:
   ```json User Search Configuration
   [
     "items[].login"
   ]
   ```

   Returnable Fields:
   ```json User Return Configuration
   [
     "items[].html_url",
     "items[].login", 
     "items[].avatar_url"
   ]
   ```

6. Save your changes, and deploy the agent

<Note>
To continue testing your agent:

1. Keep the Agent Builder tab open
2. Open the web interface by clicking the Chat URL in your agent canvas
3. Select the same conversation thread from your chat history to maintain context
</Note>

7. In the WebUI area on the left pane, run:
   ```txt Prompt
   Find 2-3 GitHub users related to MCP and Agent 2 Agent protocol
   ```

### Optimizing Commit Searches

Now, let's configure commit search operations:

1. Return to the **Builder** tab
2. Click on the gear icon next to the **Search Commits by Criteria** operation
3. Go to **Advanced** ‚Üí **Raw Editor**
4. Configure the fields:

   Searchable Fields:
   ```json Commit Search Configuration
   [
     "items[].commit.message",
     "items[].author.login",
     "items[].commit.author.name",
     "items[].repository.full_name"
   ]
   ```

   Returnable Fields:
   ```json Commit Return Configuration
   [
     "items[].html_url",
     "items[].sha",
     "items[].commit.message",
     "items[].commit.author.date",
     "items[].author.login", 
     "items[].repository.html_url"
   ]
   ```

6. Save your changes
7. In the testing area of the left pane, try a follow-up question:
   ```txt Follow-up Prompt
   Summarize their recent commits
   ```

### Optimizing Code Snippets Search

Finally, let's optimize the code snippet operation:

1. Return to the **Builder** tab
2. Click on the gear icon next to the **Find Code Snippets by Query Terms** operation
3. Go to **Advanced** ‚Üí **Raw Editor**
4. Configure the fields:

   Searchable Fields:
   ```json Searchable Fields Configuration
   [
     "items[].name",
     "items[].path",
     "items[].repository.full_name",
     "items[].repository.description"
   ]
   ```

   Returnable Fields:
   ```json Returnable Fields Configuration
   [
     "items[].html_url",
     "items[].path",
     "items[].repository.html_url",
     "items[].repository.full_name"
   ]
   ```

6. Save your changes
7. In the testing area of the left pane, run:
   ```txt Prompt
   Can you find the implementation of A2A code snippet?
   ```

The optimized results should look similar to this:

```markdown Example Output
Here are some code snippets related to "A2A" found on GitHub:

1. **Repository:** [hyunjun/bookmarks](https://github.com/hyunjun/bookmarks)
   - **File:** [c.md](https://github.com/hyunjun/bookmarks/blob/b0dce61583620ed1bff22408dfae28563e3cf28f/c.md)

```

## üìÑ Adding Code Reading Capabilities

Let's enhance our agent by adding the ability to read code directly from GitHub URLs:

1. In the left navigation menu, go to **Cloud Functions**
2. Click the **New** button
3. Add the following code:

```python GitHub Code Reader Function
# === GitHub Code Reader ===
# Contract-name: xpander_run_action
# Purpose: Retrieve any file's raw text from GitHub (public or private) so downstream
#          agents can parse the code.

# import requests ‚Äì auto-imported by the runtime
import os

def xpander_run_action(repo_full_name: str, file_path: str, ref: str = "main"):
    # GitHub Code Reader
    # ------------------
    # Args:
    #     repo_full_name : str  | "owner/repo", e.g. "org/project"
    #     file_path      : str  | path within the repo, e.g. "src/app.py"
    #     ref            : str  | branch, tag, or commit SHA (default "main")
    # Optional ENV:
    #     GIT_TOKEN            | Personal Access Token for private repositories.
    #                           If present, it's sent as a Bearer token.
    # Returns:
    #     str ‚Äì the file's text on success, or an error string on failure.

    raw_url = f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{repo_full_name}/{ref}/{file_path}"

    headers = {}
    token = os.getenv("GIT_TOKEN")
    if token:
        headers["Authorization"] = f"Bearer {token}"

    try:
        resp = requests.get(raw_url, headers=headers, timeout=15)
        resp.raise_for_status()
    except requests.RequestException as exc:
        return f"Request failed: {exc}"

    return resp.text
```

4. Name it **GitHub Code Reader** and click **Save**
5. Return to your agent in the **AI Agents** section
6. Click the **+** button
7. Select **Custom Action**
8. Add the **GitHub Code Reader** function to your agent canvas
9. Click Save -> Deploy. 

Run the following prompt

```txt Example Prompt
How can I increase throughput using cross-region inference with Amazon Bedrock and boto3? Download and provide the real python code snippet from AWS repos, not a link
```

<Frame>![](/images/screenshots/2025-05-04-01-29-12.png)</Frame>

<Note>
   The screenshot is from the agent's WebUI. You can access yours by clicking the 'Chat' button on the canvas ‚Äî the WebUI URL will appear
</Note>

## üåé Enhancing Your Agent with Web Search

Your GitHub search agent currently can only access information available on GitHub. Let's add web search capabilities to make it more versatile:

1. Return to your agent canvas
2. Click the **+** button
3. Select **Built-in Actions**
4. Add **Fetch Tavily AI Insights** (for comprehensive web searching)
5. Click on the gear icon in your agent canvas to edit the agent settings
6. Update your agent's instructions by adding these important rules:

   ```markdown Updated Instructions
   7. ALWAYS start with Tavily AI Insights to gather general information, but NEVER stop there
   8. After using Tavily, ALWAYS follow up with relevant GitHub searches to find concrete code examples and repositories
   9. For every user query, you must provide both web-based context AND GitHub-specific examples
   ```

7. Save your changes
8. In the **Tester** tab, try a query that requires recent information:
   ```txt Test Prompt
   What are the latest changes to the A2A protocol specification? Show me example implementations.
   ```

Your agent should now provide more comprehensive answers by combining web search results with GitHub code examples:

<Frame>![](/images/screenshots/2025-05-04-00-18-30.png)</Frame>

<Warning>
Sometimes, our autonomous agent might choose to use GitHub before Tavily, despite our explicit instructions. This happens because the AI model sees all available tools at once and makes decisions based on its understanding of the prompt and tool descriptions.

This reveals a fascinating design challenge in AI systems: How can we create truly autonomous agents capable of making intelligent decisions while ensuring they reliably follow critical business logic when needed? ü§î
</Warning>

## üîÑ Creating the Agent Dependency Graph

In production, to ensure your agent follows the right search strategy, we should always create a dependency graph that deterministically enforces specific business logic behavior:

1. In your agent canvas, connect your nodes to create the dependency graph
2. Set up a workflow that requires an internet search before accessing GitHub operations:
   - Connect the Tavily AI Insights node as a prerequisite to the GitHub operations
   - Ensure the flow follows a logical progression

<Frame>![Agent Dependency Graph](/images/screenshots/2025-05-03-22-42-07.png)</Frame>

3. Repeat the query with explict request to not start with Tavily

```txt test prompt
What are the latest changes to the A2A protocol specification? Show me example implementations. Use GitHub without Tavily
```

4. Validate additonal queries:

```txt Test Prompt
Using only Google's A2A protocol implementation, create an agent that responds with 'hello world'. Provide the Python code.
```

5. Verify that the AI follows the correct workflow - first searching for information before accessing GitHub operations:

<Frame>![Query Results](/images/screenshots/2025-05-03-22-41-39.png)</Frame>

<Check>
Congratulations! You've built a reliable AI Agent that balances autonomy with guardrails. By creating this structured workflow, you've effectively addressed both the API overflow challenge and solved the autonomous multi-step challenges
</Check>


# üåê Exposing Your Agent as an MCP

### Step 1: Access your Agent MCP URL

The final step is to expose your optimized GitHub agent as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server:

1. In your agent canvas, click the **+** button
2. Select **Source** ‚Üí **MCP**
3. Click **Deploy**

<Frame>![MCP Deployment](/images/screenshots/2025-05-03-23-04-13.png)</Frame>

4. After deployment, you'll receive a unique URL for your MCP server
5. Configure this endpoint in your Cursor IDE by editing the settings file:
   
   Create or edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

   ```json mcp.json
   {
     "mcpServers":{
       "xpander-github-mcp": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "xpander-mcp-remote",
           "https://mcp.xpander.ai/your-server-url/"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   <Warning>
   Make sure to replace `https://mcp.xpander.ai/your-server-url/` with your actual MCP server URL from the deployment step!
   </Warning>

### Step 2: Customize the Cursor Settings

1. Add an explicit instruction to prioritize MCP commands in the "system prompt" configuration of your Cursor IDE.

```txt Rules
If relevant to the question, always use MCP tools when available before answering
```

<Frame>![](/images/screenshots/2025-05-05-15-52-08.png)</Frame>

2. Make sure the MCP server is active (Cursor Settings -> MCP)

<Frame>![](/images/screenshots/2025-05-05-15-54-23.png)</Frame>

3. Restart Cursor IDE to apply the changes

### Step 3: Ask Cursor Agent to invoke MCP

8. Test your MCP integration by asking a question in Cursor:

   ```txt Prompt to Agent (via MCP)
   search for code samples of xpander-ai sdk
   ```

<Frame>![MCP Integration Results](/images/screenshots/2025-05-03-23-34-38.png)</Frame>
