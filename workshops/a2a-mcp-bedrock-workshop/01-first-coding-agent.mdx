title: "Module 1: Build and Understand Your First Coding Agent"
description: "Set up a local coding agent with MCP compliance and understand its core capabilities"
icon: "code"
---

In this first module, you'll clone the base coding agent repository, explore its capabilities, and understand how it integrates with xpander.ai's webUI for monitoring and control.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Have a functioning local coding agent
- Understand its code generation capabilities
- Know how to set up Git commit automation
- Grasp how the agent handles event triggers
- Monitor agent activities through the xpander.ai webUI

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Base Coding Agent Repository

Start by cloning the base coding agent repository that will serve as the foundation for this workshop:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xpander-ai/coding-agent.git
cd coding-agent
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

Install the required dependencies and configure your environment:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the .env file with your API keys
```

Open the `.env` file and add your API keys:
```
XPANDER_API_KEY=your_xpander_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 3. Explore the Agent's Core Structure

Open the main agent file `coding_agent.py` to understand how it's structured:

```python
# Key components to notice in coding_agent.py:
# 1. Initialization of the agent
# 2. Tool definitions
# 3. Agent execution loop
# 4. Event handling
# 5. Git integration
```

### 4. Run the Coding Agent

Start the coding agent:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will initialize your agent and register it with the xpander.ai platform.

### 5. Explore Core Capabilities in the Web UI

Now, let's check out how the agent's capabilities are displayed in the xpander.ai webUI:

1. Log into [app.xpander.ai](https://app.xpander.ai)
2. Navigate to the "AI Agents" section
3. Find your newly registered agent in the list

#### Code Generation Workflows

In the webUI, explore the agent's code generation capabilities:

1. Click on your agent to open its details
2. Navigate to the "Activity" tab to see past code generation activities
3. Examine a recent code generation job to see:
   - Input requirements
   - Generated code solutions
   - Any optimization steps taken

#### Git Commit Automation

Examine how the agent handles Git operations:

1. In the "Activity" tab, find a Git operation
2. See how the agent:
   - Creates new branches for features
   - Formats commit messages
   - Manages the Git workflow

### 6. Understand Event-Driven Architecture

The agent is designed with an event-driven architecture. In the webUI:

1. Go to the "Settings" tab of your agent
2. Navigate to the "Events" section
3. Review the registered event types:
   - IDE events
   - API events
   - System events

### 7. Monitor Real-Time Activities

Set up monitoring for your agent:

1. In the agent details page, navigate to the "Monitoring" tab
2. Enable real-time monitoring
3. Run a simple task on your local agent:

```bash
python task_runner.py --task "Generate a simple Python function to calculate Fibonacci numbers"
```

4. Watch the activity appear in real-time on the monitoring dashboard

## Verification

To ensure your coding agent is set up correctly:

1. Run a simple code generation task:
```bash
python task_runner.py --task "Create a REST API endpoint in Python that returns current time in different time zones"
```

2. Verify the agent creates a new branch:
```bash
git branch
# Should see a new branch created by the agent
```

3. Check the webUI Activity tab to see the recorded event

## Goal

âœ… By the end of this module, you should have a fully operational Local Coding Agent that is observable through the xpander.ai webUI, ready for the next steps in our workshop.
