In this module, you'll build your first autonomous coding agent using xpander.ai's framework. This agent will be able to understand and manipulate code, helping you automate development tasks.

🚀 In this module, you'll set up a complete AI coding assistant powered by xpander.ai and Amazon Bedrock. You'll create a local development environment, configure your agent with custom instructions, test it with repository management tasks, and connect it to the cloud for remote access. By the end, you'll have a powerful AI coding partner that can clone repositories, read and write code, and help automate your development workflow!

## 🔧 Setup Your Development Environment

Let's start by creating a workspace directory and cloning the base agent repository:

```bash
mkdir workshop 
cd workshop/
git clone https://github.com/xpander-ai/coding-agent.git
mv coding-agent dev-agent-1
cd dev-agent-1
```

Open the project in Cursor IDE:

```bash
cursor .
```

## 🛠️ Configure Your Local Environment

<Note>
  This workshop requires Python 3.12.7 or newer. To check your current version, run:
  
  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```
  
  If you need to upgrade, use the following methods:
  - **macOS**: `brew uninstall python  --ignore-dependencies && brew install python3 && python3 --version` 
  - **Windows**: Download the latest installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
</Note>

Inside the Cursor terminal, set up your Python environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install -g xpander-cli
```

## 🔑 Authenticate to xpander.ai
```bash
xpander login
```

This command will open the xpander.ai platform and ask you to login or register. Once confirmed, you will be redirected back to the terminal, which will display the following:
```bash
Hi David, Welcome to xpander!

Your organization id: {id-}
Your personal API Key is: {id-}

I've created default profile configured in ~/.xpander
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following credentials:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your_aws_session_token  # if using temporary credentials
AWS_PROFILE=your_profile # if using AWS Profile without keys
AWS_REGION=us-west-2
XPANDER_API_KEY=your_xpander_api_key ## From the output above
```

<Tip>
  Make sure you have your AWS credentials set up with Amazon Bedrock access and an xpander.ai API key ready for this step.
  If you are running this workshop in person, ask the xpander.ai team to provide you access.
</Tip>

## 🤖 Create Your Agent

Now let's use the xpander CLI to create a new agent:

```bash
xpander agent new
```

Complete the agent creation wizard:

```bash
✨ Create New Agent
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
? Enter a name for your new agent: dev-agent-1
⠋ Creating agent "dev-agent-1"...Creating agent in organization: 
✔ Agent created successfully
? Would you like to personalize your agent now? No ##
⠋ Deploying agent...Deploying agent in organization: 
✔ Agent deployed successfully

✅ Agent created and ready to use!
? Would you like to locally initialize your agent now? Yes


✨ Initializing agent
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ℹ Agent dev-agent-1 retrieved successfully
? The current directory is not empty. Proceeding will override 'requirements.txt' and add or update xpander-related files (xpander_config.json, agent_instructions.json, 
etc). Yes
✔ Agent initialized successfully
? Would you like to deploy your agent now? No
```

<Tip>
  If you skipped the init command, you can always run `xpander agent init` and select the agent you just created.
</Tip>


## ✏️ Customize Agent Instructions

Next, open `agent_instructions.json` ask Cursor to help you create effective agent instructions:

```
Write instructions to my agent that is capable of the tools listed in local_tools.py and carefully validate the code before committing it.
```

Here's an example of what your instructions might look like:

```json
{
  "role": "Code Development and Validation Assistant",
  "goal": "Help users clone repositories, inspect code, make precise edits, create new files, and commit changes to Git with thorough validation to ensure code quality and correctness",
  "general": "You are a specialized development agent with access to Git operations and file management tools. Follow these guidelines when assisting users:\n\n1. Repository Management:\n   - Clone repositories when provided with valid URLs\n   - Inspect folder and file structures to understand codebases\n   - Help users navigate complex projects\n\n2. Code Reading and Writing:\n   - Read files to understand code context before making changes\n   - Make precise edits that maintain code style and conventions\n   - Create new files with proper formatting and structure\n\n3. Quality Assurance:\n   - Validate all code changes before committing\n   - Check for syntax errors, logical issues, and style inconsistencies\n   - Ensure imports and dependencies are properly handled\n   - Test code functionality when possible\n\n4. Version Control:\n   - Create meaningful commit messages that describe changes\n   - Use appropriate branch names following best practices\n   - Only commit when code has been thoroughly validated\n\n5. Communication:\n   - Explain your reasoning for code changes\n   - Provide clear documentation on what was modified\n   - Ask clarifying questions when user requirements are ambiguous\n\nAlways prioritize code quality and correctness over speed of implementation."
}
```

## 🚀 Run Your Agent Locally

Now it's time to test your agent:

```bash
python main.py
```

<Note>
  Pay attention that the agent is limited to running inside the sandbox folder. To see files generated by the agent, navigate to the `sandboxes` folder and look for the thread ID from the terminal output.
</Note>

## 💬 Example Agent Interaction

Here's what you might see in the terminal as your agent runs:

```bash
❯ python main.py
Sandbox base directory: /Users/david/Developer/workshop/dev-agent-1/sandboxes

```

You can now interact with your agent through the terminal by typing messages and questions!

## 🌐 Stream Events from the Cloud to Your Local Agent

Now let's set up your agent to receive events from the xpander.ai cloud platform. This allows you to interact with your agent through the web UI while processing happens on your local machine.

Start the event handler to listen for cloud events:

```bash
python xpander_handler.py
```

1. Navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal output (e.g., `https://app.xpander.ai/agents/your-agent-id`)
2. You'll see your agent in the xpander.ai web interface
3. Try sending a message like "Hi" to your agent
4. Watch as the request is processed by your local machine and the response appears in the web UI

Did you notice that it returned "Your execution result"? That's a static response configured in the xpander_handler.py file.

Now, let's modify the handler to return the real agent response by updating the on_execution_request function:

```python
# Initialize agent instance
coding_agent = CodingAgent(agent=agent)

def on_execution_request(execution_task: AgentExecution) -> AgentExecutionResult:
    agent.init_task(execution=execution_task.model_dump())
    execution_status = coding_agent._agent_loop()
    
    return AgentExecutionResult(
        result=execution_status.result,
        is_success=True if execution_status.status == ExecutionStatus.COMPLETED else False,
    )
```

After making this change, you will see the following result:

<Frame>![](/images/screenshots/2025-04-29-10-09-32.png)</Frame>

This setup creates a powerful hybrid system where your agent can be accessed through the cloud interface while all the processing happens securely on your local machine.

## 🚀 Deploy to the Cloud

Deploy the agent to the cloud:

```bash
xpander deploy
```

## 🔑 Configure Cloud Environment Variables

Congratulations on deploying your agent to the cloud! While the deployment is in progress, let's configure the necessary environment variables in the xpander vault to ensure your agent can run properly in the cloud environment.

1. Navigate to the xpander.ai platform and sign in
2. Go to settings > Environment Secrets
3. Add the following keys with their respective values:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your_aws_session_token  # if using temporary credentials
```

These credentials will allow your cloud-deployed agent to access Amazon Bedrock services securely without storing sensitive information in your code.

<Tip>
  Configuring these environment variables in the vault is crucial for cloud deployment. Your local .env file is not uploaded to the cloud for security reasons, so these values must be configured separately in the xpander platform.
</Tip>

Once deployment is complete and environment variables are configured, your agent will be fully operational in the cloud, allowing others to interact with it through the web interface.

<Tip>
  run `xpander logs` to stream logs from the remote server to your terminal
</Tip>

## 🔄 Next Steps

Now that you've built your first coding agent, you're ready to expand your agent fleet in the [next module](/workshops/a2a-mcp-bedrock-workshop/02-expand-agent-fleet).
