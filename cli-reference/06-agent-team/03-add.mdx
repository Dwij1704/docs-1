## Notes

- Agents can be members of multiple teams
- Role determines:
  - Agent's responsibilities
  - Permission levels
  - Collaboration patterns
  - Communication channels
- Default role is `support` if not specified
- Configuration inherits team defaults if not specified
- Use `agent team list` to verify team membership
- Use `agent team remove` to remove an agent from a team
