## Notes

  - Removes tool-specific configuration
  - Cleans up associated resources
  - Updates agent configuration
- Use `--keep-auth` if you plan to:
  - Re-add the tool later
  - Use the same authentication with another agent
- The `--force` flag:
  - Skips confirmation prompts
  - Useful for scripted operations
  - Use with caution
- Removal is permanent unless `--keep-auth` is used
