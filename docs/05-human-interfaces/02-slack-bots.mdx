## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your agent">
    First, create and configure your agent through the xpander.ai platform. Your agent should be fully defined with the necessary tools and capabilities before connecting it to Slack.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Slack Integration">
    In the agent configuration panel, navigate to the "Human Interfaces" tab and select "Chatbots". This section manages all messaging platform integrations for your agent.
    
    Click on the Slack option to begin the configuration process.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate Configuration Token">
    You'll need a configuration token to securely connect your agent to Slack:
    
    1. Go to your workspace's configuration page
    2. Click "Generate Token" under "Your App Configuration Tokens"
    3. Copy the Access Token that appears

    <Note>
    Configuration tokens are unique to your user and workspace, not to a specific app. This means you can manage multiple agents with a single token.
    </Note>

    For more information on configuration tokens, see the [Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com/reference/manifests#config-tokens).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Slack Bot">
    In the Slack configuration dialog:
    
    1. Paste your configuration token (typically starts with xoxb-)
    2. Click "Create" to initiate the connection
    
    This action will request the necessary permissions to integrate your agent with Slack.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Approve Permissions">
    Slack will present a permission request dialog. Review what the bot will be able to access:
    
    - Content and information about channels and conversations
    - Content and information about your workspace
    - Permission to perform actions in channels and conversations
    
    <Warning>
    These permissions give your agent access to information in your Slack workspace. Only approve if you trust the agent and understand its capabilities.
    </Warning>
    
    Click "Allow" to grant these permissions and complete the integration.

## Permission Management

When connecting your AI agent to Slack, you'll need to understand the permissions model. Your agent operates within Slack's security framework, requiring specific permissions to function effectively.

### Read Access

Your agent receives permission to access channels, messages, and workspace information. This allows it to understand context and respond appropriately to queries based on available information.

### Write Access

The integration grants your agent the ability to send messages, both in direct conversations and in channels. This enables it to respond to queries and provide information proactively when appropriate.

### Interaction Permissions

Your agent can respond to mentions and direct messages, allowing users to engage with it naturally within their workflow. These permissions follow Slack's standard security model.

<Info>
You can review all permissions before approval and modify them later through Slack's app management interface if your needs change.
</Info>

## Conversation Capabilities

Once connected to Slack, your agent becomes an active participant in your workspace's communication ecosystem. The integration supports natural, contextual conversations that respect Slack's interaction patterns.

### Responsive Interactions

Your agent responds to direct messages from users, creating private one-on-one conversations. It can also reply when mentioned in channels, allowing it to participate in team discussions when invited.

### Contextual Understanding

The integration maintains context across conversation threads, enabling your agent to follow complex discussions. This context awareness creates more natural interactions that feel like talking to a knowledgeable team member.

### Tool Execution

Your agent can execute actions based on its configured tools, providing valuable functionality directly within Slack. These capabilities are defined by your agent's configuration in the xpander.ai platform.

## Configuration Options

<Accordion title="Bot Personality">
Control how your agent presents itself in Slack with these personality settings:

**Name and Avatar**: Define your agent's identity with a distinctive name and profile picture that reflects its purpose.

**Description**: Create a clear description of your agent's capabilities so users understand when and how to engage with it.

**Welcome Message**: Craft the initial message users see when first interacting with your agent to set expectations and guide them toward productive interactions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Response Settings">
Fine-tune how your agent communicates in Slack conversations:

**Response Time**: Configure whether your agent responds immediately or with a natural delay that mimics human typing patterns.

**Conversation Style**: Set the tone of your agent's communications, from formal and professional to casual and friendly, depending on your workspace culture.

**Message Formatting**: Enable rich text, code blocks, and attachments to make your agent's responses more informative and visually structured.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Access Control">
Manage who can interact with your agent and in what contexts:

**Channel Restrictions**: Limit your agent to specific channels where its expertise is most relevant, preventing noise in unrelated conversations.

**User Permissions**: Control which team members can interact with your agent, allowing you to limit access based on roles or needs.

**Command Access**: Restrict certain agent capabilities to specific user groups, creating a permissions hierarchy for different commands.
</Accordion>

## Example: LinkedIn AI Agent

The screenshots demonstrate a LinkedIn AI Agent connected to Slack. This example illustrates how a specialized agent can be integrated seamlessly into your communication workflow:

1. The agent requests specific permissions to access the xpander.ai Slack workspace
2. It receives permissions to view conversation content and workspace information
3. After approval, it can perform actions within the Slack environment
4. Users interact with it through direct messages, starting with suggested conversation starters
5. The agent responds conversationally, maintaining context throughout the interaction

This implementation shows how domain-specific AI capabilities can be brought directly into your team's daily workflow while maintaining appropriate security boundaries and access controls.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Token Expiration Issues">
Configuration tokens have a limited lifespan, typically expiring after 12 hours. If your agent suddenly stops responding or shows connection errors:

1. Generate a new configuration token from your Slack workspace settings
2. Update your agent's configuration with the fresh token
3. Verify the connection by testing a simple interaction

This refresh process ensures your agent maintains secure access to the Slack API.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Problems">
If your agent cannot access certain channels or content despite being connected:

1. Review the permissions granted during setup to ensure they're appropriate
2. Check that your agent has been explicitly invited to private channels where needed
3. Consult Slack's app management settings to verify there are no workspace-level restrictions

Remember that Slack's security model may prevent your agent from accessing historical content in channels it was recently added to.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance Considerations">
If you notice slow responses from your agent in Slack:

1. Examine your agent's runtime settings in xpander.ai to ensure sufficient resources
2. Consider Slack API rate limits that might throttle frequent interactions
3. Verify your agent's complexity and potentially simplify its decision-making process for faster responses

Optimizing these factors can significantly improve your agent's responsiveness in busy Slack environments.
</Accordion>

## Advanced Configuration

For teams requiring deeper customization, xpander.ai provides access to advanced Slack integration capabilities. These options allow you to create truly tailored experiences while leveraging the platform's robust agent framework.

### Custom Slack Commands

Create slash commands that trigger specific agent functions, allowing users to invoke capabilities with simple, memorable commands like `/analyze-data` or `/schedule-meeting`.

### Interactive Components

Implement buttons, menus, and other interactive elements in your agent's messages, creating rich interfaces that simplify complex interactions and improve user experience.
