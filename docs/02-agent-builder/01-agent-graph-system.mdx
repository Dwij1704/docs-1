## What is the Agent Graph System?

The Agent Graph System (AGS) lets you define hierarchical constraints for your AI agents, controlling which operations they can use and in what order.

<Tip>
While agents can see all available operations, they must follow the workflow you define. This balances autonomy with predictable behavior.
</Tip>

<Accordion title="When to use AGS">
- When your agent needs to follow a specific workflow with dependencies
- To prevent the agent from skipping important steps
- To enforce logical progression in data collection
- When building complex agents with multiple tools
- To guide the agent without overly restrictive instructions
</Accordion>

## Core Concepts

An agent graph consists of three simple components:

1. **Nodes** - Individual operations (tools) your agent can use
2. **Connections** - Define which operations must happen before others
3. **Hierarchical levels** - Group operations by their position in the workflow

<Accordion title="Example LinkedIn Agent Workflow">
In a LinkedIn researcher agent, you might set up a hierarchy where:
- The agent must first search for profiles (`/search-people`) 
- Only after finding profiles can it retrieve detailed data (`/get-profile-data-by-url`)

This ensures the agent can't try to get profile data before finding valid profiles to analyze.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Key Benefits">
- **Bounded autonomy**: Agents make decisions within your constraints
- **Logical gatekeeping**: Ensures prerequisites are met before advancing
- **Reduced hallucinations**: Prevents agents from making up data they should retrieve
- **Workflow optimization**: Creates efficient paths for multi-step tasks
- **Simplified maintenance**: Easier to update agent behavior by modifying the graph
</Accordion>

## Implementation Methods

You can create agent graphs using either the visual UI or programmatically with the SDK.

  <Tab title="Using the Visual Builder">
    The Xpander UI provides a drag-and-drop interface for creating agent graphs:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Access the Graph Builder">
        Navigate to your agent in the Xpander dashboard and select the "Graph" tab
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Add Operations">
        Drag operations from the sidebar into your graph workspace
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Create Connections">
        Draw lines between operations to establish dependencies
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Test Your Graph">
        Use the interface options to test your agent with different invocation methods
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Deploy">
        Save changes to deploy your updated graph
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Tip>
    The visual builder gives you all the power of AGS without writing code, making it accessible to both developers and non-developers.

      ### Multiple Prerequisites
      
      To create operations that require multiple previous steps:
      
      1. Drag all prerequisite operations into your graph
      2. Draw connection lines from each prerequisite to the dependent operation
      3. The dependent operation will only become available after all prerequisites are completed
      
      ### Creating Multiple Paths
      
      To create branching execution paths:
      
      1. Add a "parent" operation (like a search operation)
      2. Add multiple "child" operations that can follow
      3. Draw connections from the parent to each possible child
      4. The agent can choose which path to take after completing the parent operation
      
      ### Example: LinkedIn Researcher in UI
      
      The LinkedIn Researcher agent shown in the screenshot demonstrates:
      
      - **Top Level**: Search operations that run first
      - **Middle Level**: Retrieval operations that depend on search results
      - **Bottom Level**: Operations that require specific data from previous steps
    </Accordion>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Using the SDK">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Add Operations to Your Agent">
        ```python
        # Attach operations to your agent
        agent.attach_operations(operations=[search_profile_operation, get_profile_operation])
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create Graph Nodes">
        ```python
        # Create graph nodes from operations
        search_node = GraphItem(id=search_profile_operation.id)
        profile_data_node = GraphItem(id=get_profile_operation.id)
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Define Hierarchical Constraints">
        ```python
        # Create a hierarchical relationship
        # The agent must use search_node before it can use profile_data_node
        agent.add_relationship(parent=search_node, child=profile_data_node)
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Deploy Your Agent">
        ```python
        # Deploy the agent with the defined graph structure
        agent.sync()
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Accordion title="Advanced SDK Techniques">
      ### Multiple Prerequisites
      
      You can require an operation to depend on multiple previous steps:
      
      ```python
      # Operation C requires both A and B to be completed first
      agent.add_relationship(parent=operation_a, child=operation_c)
      agent.add_relationship(parent=operation_b, child=operation_c)
      ```
      
      Operation C will only become available after both A and B have been executed.
      
      ### Creating Multiple Paths
      
      Design graphs with branching execution paths:
      
      ```python
      # Create two separate paths after the search operation
      agent.add_relationship(parent=search_operation, child=profile_data_operation)
      agent.add_relationship(parent=search_operation, child=company_data_operation)
      ```
      
      This lets the agent choose between retrieving profile data or company data after completing the search.
      
      ### Complete LinkedIn Researcher Example
      
      ```python
      # Create an agent
      agent = xpander_client.agents.create(name="LinkedIn Researcher with AGS")
      
      # Find and add operations
      linkedin_interface = next((interface for interface in agent.retrieve_agentic_interfaces() 
                                if "linkedin" in interface.name.lower()), None)
      linkedin_operations = agent.retrieve_agentic_operations(agentic_interface=linkedin_interface)
      
      # Select specific operations
      search_profile_operation = next((op for op in linkedin_operations if op.path == "/search-people"), None)
      get_profile_operation = next((op for op in linkedin_operations if op.path == "/get-profile-data-by-url"), None)
      
      # Attach operations to agent
      agent.attach_operations(operations=[search_profile_operation, get_profile_operation])
      
      # Create graph nodes
      search_node = GraphItem(id=search_profile_operation.id)
      profile_data_node = GraphItem(id=get_profile_operation.id)
      
      # Define hierarchical constraint
      agent.add_relationship(parent=search_node, child=profile_data_node)
      
      # Deploy agent with graph structure
      agent.sync()
      
      print(f"LinkedIn Researcher agent with AGS deployed! Agent ID: {agent.id}")
      ```

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

<Accordion title="Best Practices">
- **Start simple**: Begin with basic dependencies before adding complexity
- **Test incrementally**: Verify each operation works before adding constraints
- **Document your design**: Keep track of the relationships you define
- **Consider edge cases**: Plan for how the agent should handle operation failures
- **Balance structure and flexibility**: Define necessary constraints without over-restricting
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Common Issues">
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Agent ignores constraints | Ensure you've called `agent.sync()` after defining relationships |
| Operations unavailable | Check that all operations are properly attached to the agent |
| Circular dependencies | Look for cycles in your graph that might prevent execution |
| Unintended restrictions | Verify constraints don't block valid execution paths |
</Accordion>
