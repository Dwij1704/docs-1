## What are Agent Tools?

Tools in xpander.ai are operations provided by app interfaces (LinkedIn, Reddit, Weather, etc.) that allow agents to interact with external systems and data sources.

<Tip>
  If you want to control how your agent uses these tools in a hierarchical structure, check out the [Agent Graph System](/docs/02-agent-builder/02-agent-graph-system) guide.
</Tip>

## Exploring Available Apps

xpander.ai provides a rich library of pre-built app interfaces that your agents can leverage without any development work. These apps span across various domains and services to help your agents accomplish a wide range of tasks.

<Accordion title="Pre-built App Interfaces">
  The app library includes connections to popular services across multiple categories:

  - **Professional Networks**: LinkedIn, Crunchbase
  - **Content Platforms**: Reddit, HackerNews
  - **Productivity Tools**: Gmail, Google Workspace
  - **Data Services**: Market Insights, Live Sports Data
  - **Research Resources**: arXiv
  - **Developer Tools**: GitHub, GitLab, Confluence
  - **Project Management**: Asana, Airtable, Figma
  - **Marketing Tools**: Google Analytics, Google Ads
  - **And many more**...

  Apps marked with "xpander built-in auth" are pre-authenticated and ready to use, while those showing "Auth required" need account credentials to be configured before use.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Creating Custom Interfaces">
  Beyond the pre-built app interfaces, xpander.ai enables you to create custom interfaces to connect to your own APIs or services:

  1. Click the "Connect new app" button
  2. Provide an app name and description
  3. Specify the web interface URL
  4. Upload an OpenAPI specification file or Postman collection

  xpander.ai's Agentic Connector Generator will automatically analyze your API specifications and generate AI-ready interfaces with properly configured operations. This transforms any API into tools your agents can use without writing code.

  <Frame>

  </Frame>
  This capability allows you to connect agents to:

  - Internal company systems
  - Custom databases
  - Proprietary services
  - Legacy systems
  - Any API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication & API Management">
  xpander.ai provides a comprehensive authentication layer that simplifies connecting to various services:

  - **Managed Authentication**: Many apps (marked "xpander built-in auth") come with pre-configured authentication, allowing immediate use without setup
  - **Custom Authentication**: For services requiring your credentials, xpander.ai offers a streamlined authentication flow
  - **Multiple Auth Methods**: Support for OAuth2, API keys, and other authentication protocols
  - **Granular Scope Control**: Configure exactly what permissions your agent needs for each service
  - **Secure Credential Storage**: All authentication details are securely stored and managed

  <Frame>

  </Frame>
  Beyond authentication, xpander.ai includes a full API management portal that helps you:

  - Browse available operations grouped by functionality
  - View detailed API documentation for each endpoint
  - Configure operation-specific parameters
  - Monitor API usage and rate limits
  - Test endpoints directly from the interface

  This comprehensive API management layer eliminates the need to build and maintain your own API integrations, saving significant development time.

## Running Your LinkedIn Researcher Agent

Once you've added tools to your agent, it's ready to use. Here's how to create and execute a task:

<Accordion title="Complete Agent Execution Code">
  ```python
  # Create a task - this automatically initializes memory
  agent.add_task("""
  Find details about David Twizer the founder of xpander.ai
  """)
  
  # Run the agent
  while not agent.is_finished():
      response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
                  model="gpt-4o",
                  messages=agent.messages,
                  tools=agent.get_tools(),
                  tool_choice=agent.tool_choice,
                  temperature=0.0
          )
              
      # Add messages from the LLM response
      agent.add_messages(response.model_dump())
      
      # Extract and run tool calls
      tool_calls = XpanderClient.extract_tool_calls(llm_response=response.model_dump())
      agent.run_tools(tool_calls=tool_calls)
  
  # Get the execution result
  execution_result = agent.retrieve_execution_result()
  print("Status:", execution_result.status)
  print("Result:", execution_result.result)
  print("Thread ID for future conversations:", execution_result.memory_thread_id)
  ```

  <Note>
    **Note**: The `add_task()` method automatically initializes the agent's memory with the input and instructions. There's no need to call `init_messages()` separately. You can also continue a previous conversation by providing a `thread_id` parameter to `add_task()`.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

## Available Interfaces

<Accordion title="Popular Interfaces">
  xpander.ai provides interfaces for various services including:

  | Interface     | Capabilities                               |
  | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
  | LinkedIn      | Search profiles, companies, jobs           |
  | Reddit        | Find posts, comments, user info            |
  | Weather       | Get conditions, forecasts, historical data |
  | Google Suite  | Interact with Gmail, Docs, Calendar        |
  | News/Research | Access arXiv papers, news articles         |

  Each interface offers operations with different capabilities and requirements.
</Accordion>

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Tool Selection Tips">
  - **Be selective**: Only add tools your agent needs for its specific task
  - **Understand parameters**: Review what each operation requires
  - **Test individually**: Verify each operation works before combining them
  - **Group logically**: Organize related operations from the same interface
  - **Document choices**: Track which operations you've added and why
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting Tool Access

When working with tools, you might encounter various issues that prevent your agent from accessing or properly using them. Here are common problems and their solutions:

<Accordion title="Authentication Errors">
  - **Invalid Signature Error**:

    ```json
    {"error": 401, "detail": {"detail": "error(401): {\"message\":\"invalid signature\"}"}
    ```

    **Solution**: Check your API key validity and ensure it hasn't expired. Regenerate your API key in the interface settings if needed.
  - **Missing Credentials**:

    ```
    Unable to list projects due to an authentication error (invalid signature). Please check your credentials and try again.
    ```

    **Solution**: Verify that you've correctly configured the authentication for the interface. For interfaces requiring OAuth, ensure you've completed the authorization flow.
  - **Token Expired**:
    **Solution**: Re-authenticate the interface by going to Interface Settings and clicking "Reconnect" for the specific interface.

  </Frame>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Debugging Tips">
  - Use the Activity View to inspect the full request and response for each tool call
  - Test operations directly from the interface page before attaching them to agents
  - For SDK usage, implement detailed logging to capture all interactions:

    ```python
    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    ```
  - Check interface connection status regularly in the dashboard
  - For custom interfaces, validate your OpenAPI specification with a tool like Swagger Editor
