## What are Agent Tools?

Tools in Xpander are operations provided by interfaces (LinkedIn, Reddit, Weather, etc.) that allow agents to interact with external systems and data sources.

<Tip>
If you want to control how your agent uses these tools in a hierarchical structure, check out the [Agent Graph System](/docs/02-agent-builder/01-agent-graph-system) guide.
</Tip>

## Exploring Available Interfaces

Xpander provides a rich library of pre-built interfaces that your agents can leverage without any development work. These interfaces span across various domains and services to help your agents accomplish a wide range of tasks.

</Frame>

<Accordion title="Pre-built Interfaces">
The interface library includes connections to popular services across multiple categories:

- **Professional Networks**: LinkedIn, Crunchbase
- **Content Platforms**: Reddit, HackerNews
- **Productivity Tools**: Gmail, Google Workspace 
- **Data Services**: Market Insights, Live Sports Data
- **Research Resources**: arXiv
- **Developer Tools**: GitHub, GitLab, Confluence
- **Project Management**: Asana, Airtable, Figma
- **Marketing Tools**: Google Analytics, Google Ads
- **And many more**...

Interfaces marked with "xpander built-in auth" are pre-authenticated and ready to use, while those showing "Auth required" need account credentials to be configured before use.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Creating Custom Interfaces">
Beyond the pre-built interfaces, Xpander enables you to create custom interfaces to connect to your own APIs or services:

1. Click the "New Custom Interface" button
2. Provide an interface name and description
3. Specify the web interface URL
4. Upload an OpenAPI specification file or Postman collection

Xpander's Agentic Connector Generator will automatically analyze your API specifications and generate AI-ready interfaces with properly configured operations. This transforms any API into tools your agents can use without writing code.

</Frame>

This capability allows you to connect agents to:
- Internal company systems
- Custom databases
- Proprietary services
- Legacy systems
- Any API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication & API Management">
Xpander provides a comprehensive authentication layer that simplifies connecting to various services:

- **Managed Authentication**: Many interfaces (marked "xpander built-in auth") come with pre-configured authentication, allowing immediate use without setup
- **Custom Authentication**: For services requiring your credentials, Xpander offers a streamlined authentication flow
- **Multiple Auth Methods**: Support for OAuth2, API keys, and other authentication protocols
- **Granular Scope Control**: Configure exactly what permissions your agent needs for each service
- **Secure Credential Storage**: All authentication details are securely stored and managed

<Frame>

</Frame>

Beyond authentication, Xpander includes a full API management portal that helps you:

- Browse available operations grouped by functionality
- View detailed API documentation for each endpoint
- Configure operation-specific parameters
- Monitor API usage and rate limits
- Test endpoints directly from the interface

This comprehensive API management layer eliminates the need to build and maintain your own API integrations, saving significant development time.

## Adding Tools to Your Agent

You can add tools to your agents using either the visual UI or programmatically with the SDK.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using the UI">
    Xpander's visual interface makes adding tools intuitive without writing code:
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Access the Interfaces Panel">
        Navigate to your agent and click the "Interfaces" button in the top-right corner
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Browse Available Tools">
        Explore interfaces like LinkedIn, Reddit, and more
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Select Operations">
        Choose the specific operations you want to add to your agent
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Configure Settings">
        Adjust any operation-specific settings if needed
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Add to Agent">
        Click "Add" to attach the operations to your agent
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    
    <Frame>
    ![LinkedIn Agent with Tools](/static/images/screenshots/2025-03-15-23-15-24.png)
    </Frame>
    
    <Accordion title="Organizing Tools Visually">
    After adding operations:
    
    1. Click the "Graph" tab to see all operations
    2. Drag operations to rearrange them
    3. Draw connections to create dependencies
    4. Test directly from the interface
    
    This visual approach makes it easier to understand how your agent's tools relate to each other.
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Testing in Real-Time">
    The UI provides multiple testing options:
    
    - **Chat**: Test in a conversational interface
    - **Task**: Run specific tasks with detailed logs
    - **Webhook**: Configure webhook integrations
    - **SDK**: Generate SDK integration code
    
    These options appear at the top of the agent interface.
    
    For detailed analysis of your agent's execution, check the [Activity view](/docs/02-agent-builder/03-activity-view), which provides full visibility into operations, API calls, and LLM responses.

## Running Your LinkedIn Researcher Agent

Once you've added tools to your agent, it's ready to use. Here's how to create and execute a task:

<Accordion title="Complete Agent Execution Code">
```python
# Create a task
agent.add_task("""
Find details about David Twizer the founder of xpander.ai
""")

# Initialize the agent's memory
agent.memory.init_messages(input=agent.execution.input_message, instructions=agent.instructions)

# Run the agent
while not agent.is_finished():
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
                model="gpt-4o",
                messages=agent.messages,
                tools=agent.get_tools(),
                tool_choice=agent.tool_choice,
                temperature=0.0
        )
            
    # Add messages from the LLM response
    agent.add_messages(response.model_dump())
    
    # Extract and run tool calls
    tool_calls = XpanderClient.extract_tool_calls(llm_response=response.model_dump())
    agent.run_tools(tool_calls=tool_calls)

# Get the execution result
execution_result = agent.retrieve_execution_result()
print("Status:", execution_result.status)
print("Result:", execution_result.result)
```

The agent will:
1. Search for the requested information on LinkedIn
2. Retrieve detailed profile data
3. Return a comprehensive report with professional details
</Accordion>

## Available Interfaces

<Accordion title="Popular Interfaces">
Xpander provides interfaces for various services including:

| Interface | Capabilities |
|-----------|--------------|
| LinkedIn | Search profiles, companies, jobs |
| Reddit | Find posts, comments, user info |
| Weather | Get conditions, forecasts, historical data |

</Accordion>

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Tool Selection Tips">
- **Be selective**: Only add tools your agent needs for its specific task
- **Understand parameters**: Review what each operation requires
- **Test individually**: Verify each operation works before combining them
- **Group logically**: Organize related operations from the same interface
- **Document choices**: Track which operations you've added and why
