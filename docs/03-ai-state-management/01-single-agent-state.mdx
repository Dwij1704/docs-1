# Single Agent State Management

Managing state for individual AI agents is crucial for maintaining context and ensuring consistent behavior across interactions.

## State Components

The state of a single agent consists of:

- Conversation history
- Memory storage
- Tool configurations
- User preferences
- Environmental variables

## State Persistence

Learn how to:

- Save and load agent state
- Handle state transitions
- Implement state recovery
- Manage state versioning

## State Access Patterns

Best practices for:

- Reading state data
- Updating state safely
- State synchronization
- Error handling

## Memory Management

Techniques for:

- Efficient memory usage
- State cleanup
- Memory optimization
- Handling large state objects

## Examples

```typescript
// Example of managing agent state
const agent = new Agent({
  stateConfig: {
    persistence: true,
    memoryLimit: '1GB',
    autoCleanup: true
  }
});

// Save state
await agent.saveState();

// Load state
await agent.loadState(stateId);
```
