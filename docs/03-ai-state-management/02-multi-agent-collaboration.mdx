# Multi-Agent Collaboration

Enable multiple AI agents to work together efficiently by managing their interactions, shared state, and communication channels.

## Collaboration Models

xpander.ai supports various collaboration models:

- Hierarchical (supervisor-worker)
- Peer-to-peer
- Hub-and-spoke
- Mesh network

## Setting Up Collaboration

```typescript
// Create a collaborative network
const network = new AgentNetwork({
  name: 'TaskNetwork',
  topology: 'hierarchical'
});

// Add agents to the network
network.addAgent(supervisorAgent, { role: 'supervisor' });
network.addAgent(workerAgent1, { role: 'worker' });
network.addAgent(workerAgent2, { role: 'worker' });

// Define communication channels
network.defineChannel({
  from: 'supervisor',
  to: 'worker',
  type: 'task-assignment'
});
```

## Shared State Management

- State synchronization
- Conflict resolution
- Consistency patterns
- Transaction management

## Communication Protocols

Implement various protocols:

- Direct messaging
- Broadcast messages
- Pub/sub patterns
- Event-driven communication

## Task Distribution

Strategies for:

- Load balancing
- Task prioritization
- Resource allocation
- Failure handling

## Monitoring and Debugging

Tools for:

- Network visualization
- Performance monitoring
- Communication logging
- State inspection

## Best Practices

- Design for fault tolerance
- Implement deadlock prevention
- Monitor resource usage
- Handle network partitions
- Maintain security boundaries
