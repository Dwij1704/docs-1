## What you will achieve in this quickstart guide:
1. Design an AI Agent in the Workbench, including: The AI Agent state machine, tools (API function calling), and system instructions.
2. Use the visual tester to test the behavior and tool calling.
3. Chat to the AI Agent from an external source (fully hosted Chainlit).
4. Apply the design and configuration to an AI Agent in code.

## Using the AI Agent Workbench

<Steps>

<Step title="Log in to the xpander.ai platform.">
  Go to [https://app.xpander.ai](https://app.xpander.ai) and sign in with your credentials.

        </Frame>
      For this quickstart, use the following prompt:
      "Build an AI Agent that is able to get the top stories and their item details from Hacker News"
      <Tip>This action will automatically: design the AI Agent state machine, add the relevant tools to the AI Agent, and write the AI Agent system level instructions.</Tip>
      <Note>It could take up to a minute for the Planner agent to complete the AI Agent design and configuration.</Note>

      </Step>

      <Step>

      Your result should be similar to:

# xpander-sdk in your AI Agent code


<Card title="The magic of the xpander.ai Agent Platform starts here" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" horizontal>
The state machine, tools, instructions and other configurations will now be enforced by the `xpander SDK` in your own AI Agent code.
</Card>


### Set up Python virtual environment, install packages, and add environment variables.

To start using the xpander SDK in your AI Agent code, let's set up a virtual environment.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a project and virtual environment">
    Create a new project directory and set up a Python virtual environment:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir my_project
    cd my_project
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Activate the virtual environment">
    Do this every time you start a new terminal session:
    
    ```bash
    # On macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    
    # On Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the xpander SDK">
    Install the following packages:
    
    ```bash
    pip install xpander-sdk
    pip install openai
    pip install dotenv
    ```
  </Step> 
 
      <Step title="Set up environment variables in .env file">
        Grab these two API keys and the AI Agent ID and place them in your `.env` file:

- **OpenAI Key** from [https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)  
- **Your AI Agent ID** â€” by clicking the **SDK** trigger node at the top of the graph in the AI Agent Workbench  
- **Your default API key** From the same screen, also check the box next to the default API key and copy the API key

<Frame>
  ![](/static/images/screenshots/api-keys.png)
</Frame>

```bash
echo "XPANDER_API_KEY=<your_key>" >> .env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key>" >> .env  
echo "XPANDER_AGENT_ID=<your_agent_id>" >> .env  
```
        Make sure the three parameters are correctly added to the .env file.
  </Step>

</Steps>

## AI Agent code setup
<Steps>
 
  <Step title="Load packages and environment variables, and initialize the clients">
        Create your agent.py file, and let's start building it step by step. The following code will load the packages and keys, and initialize the clients:
        
        ```python
        from xpander_sdk import XpanderClient
        from openai import OpenAI
        from dotenv import load_dotenv
        from os import environ

        load_dotenv()
        OPENAI_API_KEY = environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
        XPANDER_API_KEY = environ["XPANDER_API_KEY"]
        XPANDER_AGENT_ID = environ["XPANDER_AGENT_ID"]

        # Initialize clients
        xpander_client = XpanderClient(api_key=XPANDER_API_KEY)
        openai_client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

        # Get your agent
        agent = xpander_client.agents.get(agent_id=XPANDER_AGENT_ID)
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Create a task and initialize state">
        This code creates an immutable task for the agent. Tasks are immutable by design, allowing you to track state changes throughout execution:
        
        ```python
        # Create a task for the agent
        task1 = agent.add_task("""
        Summarize the last 24 hours top hackernews posts
        """)
        ```
        
        <Accordion title="Understanding Task Creation and State Initialization">
        When you create a task with `agent.add_task()`, xpander:
        
        1. Creates an immutable task record that persists throughout execution
        2. Generates a unique execution ID to track this specific agent run
        3. Sets up an initial input message that becomes available as `agent.execution.input_message`
        4. Initializes the agent's memory with the task input and instructions
        
        The task creation automatically:
        
        1. Initializes the agent's working memory with the task input and instructions
        2. Establishes the initial state for the agent's execution
        3. Prepares the message history that will be sent to the LLM
        
        The immutability of tasks ensures you always have a reliable record of what was requested, while the memory system handles the evolving state of the agent as it works. This separation of concerns allows for reliable tracking, debugging, and auditing of agent behavior.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Agent Input Message Format">
        ```json
        {
          "content": "Summarize the last 24 hours top hackernews",
          "role": "user"
        }
        ```
        
        The input message follows a standard chat format with a role and content. This is automatically generated from your task description and becomes available as `agent.execution.input_message`.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Agent Instructions Format">
        ```json
        {
          "general": "You are a Hacker News summarization agent. Retrieve top stories, fetch details, and generate concise summaries using Perplexity AI. Format and present the summarized news. End with xpfinish-agent-execution-finished.\n        IMPORTANT: when making a sub-task (with input_task), make sure to append all related \n        information relevant for the sub-task. For instance, if the sub-task is about sending \n        an email with tags, ensure the tags and any required data are included in the input_task.\n        \n        - Execute tools as needed to complete tasks.  \n        - If a tool fails 3 times, execution stalls, or no tool is called for an extended period, stop immediately and report the issue along with any relevant results or errors.\n        ",
          "goal": "Retrieve top stories from Hacker News, fetch detailed content for each story, generate concise summaries, and format the results for presentation. Finalize with xpfinish-agent-execution-finished, returning the summarized news articles in the 'results'.",
          "role": "Expert in retrieving and processing Hacker News stories, responsible for fetching top stories and their details"
        }
        ```
        
        The instructions object provides comprehensive guidance to the agent:
        - `general`: Overall instructions, constraints, and operational guidelines
        - `goal`: Specific objective the agent needs to accomplish
        - `role`: Identity and responsibilities the agent should assume
        
        These instructions are used to initialize the agent's memory and guide its decision-making throughout execution.
        </Accordion>
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Add the AI Agent loop">
        Add the following code to your agent.py file. 
        
        ```python
        # Run the agent until completion
        while not agent.is_finished():
            # Get LLM response with available tools
            response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
                model="gpt-4o",
                messages=agent.messages,
                tools=agent.get_tools(),
                tool_choice=agent.tool_choice,
                temperature=0.0
            )
                    
            # Process LLM response
            agent.add_messages(response.model_dump())
            
            # Extract and run tool calls
            tool_calls = XpanderClient.extract_tool_calls(llm_response=response.model_dump())
            agent.run_tools(tool_calls=tool_calls)
        ```
        
        The `is_finished()` API checks the execution state of the agent, enabling you to control the execution loop programmatically. This approach gives you full visibility into the agent's execution process.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Retrieve execution results">
        Once execution is complete, this code retrieves the immutable execution result:
        
        ```python
        # Get final results
        execution_result = agent.retrieve_execution_result()
        print("Status:", execution_result.status)
        print("Result:", execution_result.result)
        ```
        
        The execution result is immutable, meaning it can be safely retrieved at any point during or after execution without affecting the agent's state. This design allows you to monitor progress or record results while the agent continues processing.
      </Step>

      <Step>
      Run the agent.py file in your IDE or via the command line by running `python agent.py`


Example output:

```markdown
# execution_result.status
Status: ExecutionStatus.COMPLETED

# execution_result.result
