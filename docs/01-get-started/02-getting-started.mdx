## Set Up Your Environment

Before building your first AI Agent with xpander.ai, let's set up your development environment.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a project and virtual environment">
    Create a new project directory and set up a Python virtual environment:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir my_project
    cd my_project
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Activate the virtual environment">
    Do this every time you start a new terminal session:
    
    ```bash
    # On macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    
    # On Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install the xpander SDK">
    Install the xpander SDK using pip:
    
    ```bash
    pip install xpander-sdk
    ```
  </Step>
 
</Steps>

     ## Hello world example - starting from the xpander.ai Workbench, or from the CLI

      </Step>

      <Step title="Move to the tester tab and start prompting your AI Agent to see its behavior. You will see the decision making process in the graph indicated by the moving Purple dot, as well as the request/response process in the left panel.">

      <Step title='Click the Chat trigger node, and click the URL for your hosted Chainlit instance. You can continue prompting your AI Agent from this external source.'>

        </Frame>        
      </Step>

      <Step title="Connect to your AI agent programmatically">
        Now that you designed your AI Agent in the xpander.ai console, you can use the xpander-sdk to use it programmatically with full control over the execution loop.
        First, you need to grab these three keys and parameters and place them in your `.env` file:

- **OpenAI Key** from [https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)  
- **Your AI Agent ID** — by clicking the **SDK** trigger node in the Workbench  
- From the same place, also check the box next to the default API key and copy the API key

<Frame>
  ![](/static/images/screenshots/api-keys.png)
</Frame>

```bash
echo "XPANDER_API_KEY=<your_key>" >> .env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key>" >> .env  
echo "XPANDER_AGENT_ID=<your_agent_id>" >> .env  
```
        Then, load the packages and keys, and initialize the clients:
        
        ```python
            from xpander_sdk import XpanderClient
            from openai import OpenAI
            from dotenv import load_dotenv
            from os import environ

            load_dotenv()
            OPENAI_API_KEY = environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
            XPANDER_API_KEY = environ["XPANDER_API_KEY"]
            XPANDER_AGENT_ID = environ["XPANDER_AGENT_ID"]

            # Initialize clients
            xpander_client = XpanderClient(api_key=XPANDER_API_KEY)
            openai_client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

            # Get your agent
            agent = xpander_client.agents.get(agent_id=XPANDER_AGENT_ID)
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Create a task and initialize state">
        Create an immutable task for the agent. Tasks are immutable by design, allowing you to track state changes throughout execution:
        
        ```python
        # Create a task for the agent
        task1 = agent.add_task("""
        Summarize the last 24 hours top hackernews posts
        """)

        # Initialize agent memory with the task
        agent.memory.init_messages(
            input=agent.execution.input_message,
            instructions=agent.instructions
        )
        ```
        
        <Accordion title="Understanding Task Creation and State Initialization">
        When you create a task with `agent.add_task()`, xpander:
        
        1. Creates an immutable task record that persists throughout execution
        2. Generates a unique execution ID to track this specific agent run
        3. Sets up an initial input message that becomes available as `agent.execution.input_message`
        
        The `agent.memory.init_messages()` call then:
        
        1. Initializes the agent's working memory with the task input and instructions
        2. Establishes the initial state for the agent's execution
        3. Prepares the message history that will be sent to the LLM
        
        The immutability of tasks ensures you always have a reliable record of what was requested, while the memory system handles the evolving state of the agent as it works. This separation of concerns allows for reliable tracking, debugging, and auditing of agent behavior.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Agent Input Message Format">
        ```json
        {
          "content": "Summarize the last 24 hours top hackernews",
          "role": "user"
        }
        ```
        
        The input message follows a standard chat format with a role and content. This is automatically generated from your task description and becomes available as `agent.execution.input_message`.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Agent Instructions Format">
        ```json
        {
          "general": "You are a Hacker News summarization agent. Retrieve top stories, fetch details, and generate concise summaries using Perplexity AI. Format and present the summarized news. End with xpfinish-agent-execution-finished.\n        IMPORTANT: when making a sub-task (with input_task), make sure to append all related \n        information relevant for the sub-task. For instance, if the sub-task is about sending \n        an email with tags, ensure the tags and any required data are included in the input_task.\n        \n        - Execute tools as needed to complete tasks.  \n        - If a tool fails 3 times, execution stalls, or no tool is called for an extended period, stop immediately and report the issue along with any relevant results or errors.\n        ",
          "goal": "Retrieve top stories from Hacker News, fetch detailed content for each story, generate concise summaries, and format the results for presentation. Finalize with xpfinish-agent-execution-finished, returning the summarized news articles in the 'results'.",
          "role": "Expert in retrieving and processing Hacker News stories, responsible for fetching top stories and their details"
        }
        ```
        
        The instructions object provides comprehensive guidance to the agent:
        - `general`: Overall instructions, constraints, and operational guidelines
        - `goal`: Specific objective the agent needs to accomplish
        - `role`: Identity and responsibilities the agent should assume
        
        These instructions are used to initialize the agent's memory and guide its decision-making throughout execution.
        </Accordion>
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Execute the agent loop locally (optional)">
        Run the agent execution loop locally. The `is_finished()` method allows you to check if the agent has completed its task, errored out, or is still processing:
        
        ```python
        # Run the agent until completion
        while not agent.is_finished():
            # Get LLM response with available tools
            response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
                model="gpt-4o",
                messages=agent.messages,
                tools=agent.get_tools(),
                tool_choice=agent.tool_choice,
                temperature=0.0
            )
                    
            # Process LLM response
            agent.add_messages(response.model_dump())
            
            # Extract and run tool calls
            tool_calls = XpanderClient.extract_tool_calls(llm_response=response.model_dump())
            agent.run_tools(tool_calls=tool_calls)
        ```
        
        The `is_finished()` API checks the execution state of the agent, enabling you to control the execution loop programmatically. This approach gives you full visibility into the agent's execution process.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Retrieve execution results">
        Once execution is complete, you can retrieve the immutable execution result:
        
        ```python
        # Get final results
        execution_result = agent.retrieve_execution_result()
        print("Status:", execution_result.status)
        print("Result:", execution_result.result)
        ```
        
        The execution result is immutable, meaning it can be safely retrieved at any point during or after execution without affecting the agent's state. This design allows you to monitor progress or record results while the agent continues processing.

## Model & Framework Flexibility

xpander.ai is completely model-agnostic and framework-agnostic, giving you maximum flexibility in how you build and deploy your AI agents:

- **No-Code Option**: The xpander Workbench lets you create fully functional agents without writing a single line of code. This is a great starting point for early prototyping, before moving to production-grade AI Agents that you deploy in your CI/CD process.

- **Any LLM Model**: Use OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, or other LLM providers based on your specific needs and preferences.

- **Any Agent Framework**: Seamlessly integrate with popular agent frameworks like LangGraph or HuggingFace's Smoleagents while leveraging xpander's enhanced capabilities.

For more advanced code-based implementations after creating your agent in the platform:

- See [Start with LLM Models](/docs/01-get-started/02-llm-models) for direct integration with various LLM providers
- See [Start with Agent Frameworks](/docs/01-get-started/03-agent-frameworks) for using xpander with existing agent frameworks
