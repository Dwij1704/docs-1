xpander.ai is the AI Agent platform that accelerates developer experience for building, testing and deploying AI agents. It allows developers to design AI Agent behaviors, and invoke them with an SDK. The SDK can be used with popular AI frameworks such as SmolAgents and LangGraph, as well as with LLM provider SDKs such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini while maintaining flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in.

The platform handles the complex infrastructure needed for managing thousands of AI Agent to user interactions, maintaining complex AI agent states via the state machine, and orchestrating multi-step agent workflows. This comprehensive approach lets developers focus exclusively on agent logic rather than worrying about underlying infrastructure concerns.


## Core design principles:

1. **Focus on agent logic, not infrastructure**: The xpander engine handles complex state management, scaling, and deployment concerns so you can focus on what your AI agents do.

2. **Framework and provider independence**: Build once and deploy with any LLM provider or agent framework without rewriting your code.

## Platform Value Propositions

✅ **Unified state management** — Built-in memory objects make agents stateful, with thread support across frameworks.

✅ **Agent-to-Tools** — Instantly convert any REST API using Xpander's tool generator and use it as a standalone MCP or agent function.

✅ **Out-of-the-box Agent-to-Agent protocol** — Complete orchestration rules between agents with no additional coding.

✅ **LLM-agnostic** — Compatible with OpenAI, Bedrock, Anthropic, and more LLM providers.

✅ **Framework-agnostic** — Works seamlessly across LangChain, LlamaIndex, HuggingFace, CrewAI, and other agent frameworks.

✅ **Human interfaces out-of-the-box** — REST API, Web UI, MCP, and Webhook support included.

✅ **Runs anywhere** — Deploy on managed runtime or your own infrastructure.

## Model & Framework Flexibility

xpander.ai is completely model-agnostic and framework-agnostic, giving you maximum flexibility in how you build and deploy your AI agents:

- **No-Code Option**: The xpander Workbench lets you create fully functional agents without writing a single line of code. This is a great starting point for early prototyping, before moving to production-grade AI Agents that you deploy in your CI/CD process.

- **Any LLM Model**: Use OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, or other LLM providers based on your specific needs and preferences.

- **Any Agent Framework**: Seamlessly integrate with popular agent frameworks like LangGraph or HuggingFace's Smoleagents while leveraging xpander's enhanced capabilities.

For more advanced code-based implementations after creating your agent in the platform:

- See [Start with LLM SDKs](/docs/01-get-started/03-llm-models) for direct integration with various LLM providers
- See [Start with Agent Frameworks](/docs/01-get-started/04-agent-frameworks) for using xpander with existing agent frameworks
