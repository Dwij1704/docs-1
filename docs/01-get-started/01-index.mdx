xpander is a backend for AI Agents which allows to build, enhance, and deploy AI agents that can interact with 1000s of users from multiple human interfaces (Voice, Chat, Web, etc) and that can use multiple tools (API, Web, File, etc) and that can have complex state and conversation history using AI state management. The platform natively supports multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc) and multiple frameworks (LlamaIndex, Smoleagents (HuggingFace), etc).

### Why xpander?

- **A stateful and scalable AI Agent runtime**

- **Open integration across AI stacks**

- **Reliable, long-running AI automation without vendor lock-in**

- **A simple, CLI-based onboarding experience to enhance AI Agents quickly**

### With xpander, you can:~

- Manage AI session states seamlessly, ensuring long-running AI agents operate efficiently.

- Connect AI Agents to any API in your tech stack avoiding vendor lock-in.

- Build within few minutes and share it widely.

- Enhance existing AI agents (LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.) with xpander’s capabilities.

### How is xpander different

- It doesn’t force users into a specific stack. It offers an AI State Machine, governed runtime, API connectivity, and an enterprise-grade execution layer.
- Just as Databricks standardizes data processing, xpander.ai enables AI Agents to work across environments (cloud, VPC, on-prem) with multiple frameworks.
