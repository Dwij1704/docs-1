xpander.ai is the AI Agent platform that accelerates developer experience for building, testing and deploying AI agents. It allows developers to design AI Agent behaviors, and invoke them with an SDK. The SDK can be used with popular AI frameworks such as SmolAgents and LangGraph, as well as with LLM provider SDKs such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini while maintaining flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in.

The platform handles the complex infrastructure needed for managing thousands of AI Agent to user interactions, maintaining complex AI agent states via the state machine, and orchestrating multi-step agent workflows. This comprehensive approach lets developers focus exclusively on agent logic rather than worrying about underlying infrastructure concerns.


## Core design principles:

1. **Focus on agent logic, not infrastructure**: The xpander engine handles complex state management, scaling, and deployment concerns so you can focus on what your AI agents do.

2. **Framework and provider independence**: Build once and deploy with any LLM provider or agent framework without rewriting your code.
