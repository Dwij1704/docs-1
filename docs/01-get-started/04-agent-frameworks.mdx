## Why use xpander with existing frameworks?

While frameworks like SmolAgents, LlamaIndex, and CrewAI provide powerful agent capabilities, they often lack the production infrastructure needed for real-world deployment. xpander.ai enhances these frameworks with:

- **Persistent State Management**: Scale to thousands of concurrent users while maintaining complex agent state across sessions
- **Enhanced Agentic Tools**: Access a unified toolkit of powerful connectors and integrations that work across frameworks:
  - Automatically generated AI connectors from API docs or HTTP traffic analysis
  - Pre-built integrations with popular services (LinkedIn, YC, Hacker News, etc.)
  - Framework-specific tool adapters that maintain consistent behavior across providers
  - Tool composition capabilities for building complex multi-step workflows
- **Human Interfaces & Authentication**: Easily connect your agents to Slack, Teams, REST APIs, voice interfaces, or hosted WebUIs like Chainlit with minimal configuration, while managing secure user authentication and access control
- **Security & Compliance**: Deploy on-premises within your organization's VPC for complete data control

xpander.ai doesn't replace your favorite agent framework â€” it supercharges it with production-ready capabilities.

## Implementation Examples

Choose this approach when you want to leverage existing agent frameworks with added xpander.ai capabilities like state management, authentication, and enhanced tools.

<CodeGroup>
```python Smoleagents (Hugging Face)
query = "Hello, world! You are AI Agent with State managed by xpander.ai. You are now have access to more tools, authenticate users, and preserve state, return to tasks later"

smolagent = CodeAgent(
		    tools=[xpander_agent.get_tools("smolagents")],
		    model=LiteLLMModel(model_id=xpander.get_model()),
		)
smolagent.memory = xpander_agent.get_memory(agent.to_dict())
result = smolagent.run(query)
xpander_agent.send_result(result)
```

```python LlamaIndex
query = "Hello, world! You are AI Agent with State managed by xpander.ai. You are now have access to more tools, authenticate users, and preserve state, return to tasks later"

# Initialize LlamaIndex agent with xpander tools and memory
agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(
    tools=xpander_agent.get_tools("llamaindex"),
    llm=OpenAI(model=xpander.get_model()),
    memory=xpander_agent.get_memory(agent.to_dict()),
    verbose=True
)

# Run the query and send results
response = agent.chat(query)
xpander_agent.send_result(response)
```

```python CrewAI
query = "Hello, world! You are AI Agent with State managed by xpander.ai. You are now have access to more tools, authenticate users, and preserve state, return to tasks later"

# Create agent with xpander tools
agent = Agent(
    role="Assistant",
    goal="Help users with their queries",
    backstory="AI assistant with enhanced capabilities through xpander.ai",
    tools=xpander_agent.get_tools("crewai"),
    llm=xpander.get_model()
)

# Create crew with single agent and memory
crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent],
    memory=xpander_agent.get_memory(agent.to_dict())
)

# Execute task and send results
result = crew.execute(query)
xpander_agent.send_result(result)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Event streaming (Slack, Teams, RestAPI, Realtime voice)

<CodeGroup>
```python Smoleagents (Hugging Face)
def handle_event(event):
		smolagent = CodeAgent(
		    tools=[xpander_agent.get_tools("smolagents")],
		    model=LiteLLMModel(model_id=xpander.get_model()),
		)
		smolagent.memory = xpander_agent.get_memory(agent.to_dict())
    result = smolagent.run(event.payload)
    xpander_agent.send_result(result)

xpander_agent.start_event_listener()
```

```python LlamaIndex
def handle_event(event):
    agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(
        tools=xpander_agent.get_tools("llamaindex"),
        llm=OpenAI(model=xpander.get_model()),
        memory=xpander_agent.get_memory(agent.to_dict()),
        verbose=True
    )
    response = agent.chat(event.payload)
    xpander_agent.send_result(response)

xpander_agent.start_event_listener()
```

```python CrewAI
def handle_event(event):
    agent = Agent(
        role="Assistant",
        goal="Help users with their queries",
        backstory="AI assistant with enhanced capabilities through xpander.ai",
        tools=xpander_agent.get_tools("crewai"),
        llm=xpander.get_model()
    )
    
    crew = Crew(
        agents=[agent],
        memory=xpander_agent.get_memory(agent.to_dict())
    )
    
    result = crew.execute(event.payload)
    xpander_agent.send_result(result)

xpander_agent.start_event_listener()
```
