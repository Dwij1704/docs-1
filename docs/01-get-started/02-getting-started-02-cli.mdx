## Using the xpander CLI

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install the CLI">
        Install the xpander CLI globally:

        ```bash
        npm install -g xpander-cli
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure your credentials">
        Set up your API key and organization:

        ```bash
        xpander configure
        ```

        You'll see output similar to:

        ```
        You need to configure your credentials to use the Xpander CLI.
        ? Would you like to configure your credentials now? Yes
        ? Enter your Xpander API key: IhPLk2Cu5BXw5BmVBhld3p31mTpAxC892pD6O5E3
        API Key: IhPL...O5E3 (first and last 4 characters shown)
        ✔ API key validation successful
        API key saved to profile "default".
        Organization ID will be auto-detected for you now...
        ⠏ Detecting organization ID...Organization ID detected: 8d185373-8b24-47a7-8607-3e9036b968bb
        Organization ID saved to profile "default".
        ✔ Organization ID detected: 8d185373-8b24-47a7-8607-3e9036b968bb
        Found 1 agent(s) in your organization.
        Set "default" as the default profile.
        Credentials stored at: /Users/david/.xpander/credentials
        Profile: default

        Configuration successful.
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create a new agent">
        Create your agent using the CLI:

        ```bash
        xpander agent new
        ```

        Follow the interactive prompts to define your agent's capabilities and behavior.


      </Step>
            <Step title="Add tools to the AI Agent">
      1. Open the AI Agent Workbench
      2. Add the HackerNews top stories operations
      3. Deploy the AI Agent.

        </Step>

      <Step title="Connect to your agent programmatically">
        The following steps show how to execute your agent created with the CLI:
        
        ```python
        from xpander import XpanderClient
        from openai import OpenAI

        # Initialize clients
        xpander_client = XpanderClient(api_key=XPANDER_API_KEY)
        openai_client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

        # Get your agent
        agent = xpander_client.agents.get(agent_id=XPANDER_AGENT_ID)
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Execute your agent">
        Use the same execution pattern as shown in the Workbench approach. For more details on working with different LLM models, refer to the [LLM SDKs documentation](/docs/01-get-started/03-llm-models).

        ```python
        # Create a task for the agent
        task = agent.add_task("Your task description here")

        # Run the agent until completion
        while not agent.is_finished():
            response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
                model="gpt-4o",
                messages=agent.messages,
                tools=agent.get_tools(),
                tool_choice=agent.tool_choice,
                temperature=0.0
            )
                    
            agent.add_messages(response.model_dump())
            
            tool_calls = XpanderClient.extract_tool_calls(llm_response=response.model_dump())
            agent.run_tools(tool_calls=tool_calls)

        # Get results
        execution_result = agent.retrieve_execution_result()
        print("Status:", execution_result.status)
        print("Result:", execution_result.result)
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step>
