The xpander.ai Agent Graph System (AGS) is the core framework that maps prompts to actionable sequences, enabling AI Agents to execute tasks reliably and efficiently, while enforcing the AI Agent to only use operations that are available to it according to its location on the graph.

## What is the Agent Graph System?

The AGS is an automatically generated structure created as you interact with the Agent Builder. It organizes prompts into Topics, linking them to configured Operations and Functions. The AGS ensures that every input to your Agent follows a clear and actionable workflow.

## How the Agent Graph System Works

The Agent Graph System is built dynamically within the Agent Builder. Each interaction in the Chat interface generates new nodes and paths in the AGS. These represent prompt groups and corresponding operations that guide the Agentâ€™s actions.

## Viewing and Editing the Agent Graph System

The AGS is editable, allowing you to fine-tune how prompts are categorized and connected to Operations. You can add, remove, or rearrange nodes to refine the Agent's workflows.

## Configuring Operations in the AGS

The AGS depends on the Operations you select for your AI Agent. These Operations are the building blocks of the graph and represent the tools available to the Agent. Adding or removing Operations dynamically adjusts the paths the AGS can generate.

## Basic steps to work with the Agent Graph System

Follow these steps to use and refine the AGS:

1. Open the Agent Builder and start chatting with your Agent to generate the AGS.

2. Click on a node in the Graph System interface to view its details or edit it.

3. Use the **Interfaces** menu to adjust the set of tools available for the AGS.

4. Save your changes to finalize the Agent Graph System
