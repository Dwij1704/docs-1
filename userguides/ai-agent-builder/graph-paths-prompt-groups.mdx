In the Agent Graph System (AGS), you can create multiple Topics. Each Topic is represented as a visual group with Operations. Here's a quick explanation of what each of these terms mean:

* Topics are like a sub-graph of the AGS that each xpander.ai AI Agent is built around. A Topic allows you to create a closed area of operations in your AI Agent, in order to increase the reliability and accuracy of how the AI Agent traverses the different Operations in the AGS.

* Each Topic has a list of Prompts associated with it. You can view and edit prompts by clicking the Prompts button in the header of the topic. When the AI Agent is running, every incoming prompt will be matched to one or more prompt groups, and when the AI Agent is performing tool calls when running inside a specific Topic, it will only be able to execute the Operations within that Topic.

<Tip>Example: You can create a Topic that will contain Operations referring to stock prices. Then, in the sub-graph, make sure that only Operations/Functions relevant to checking stock prices are added. This means that any incoming prompt to the AI Agent that is semnatically similar to the prompts in the *Stock prices* will limit the AI Agent to the Operations/Functions in the same sub-graph</Tip>
