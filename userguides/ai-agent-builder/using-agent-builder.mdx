title: 'Using the AI Agent Builder'
---

The Agent Builder in xpander.ai is a powerful, visual tool that empowers developers to design, configure, and deploy intelligent AI Agents capable of autonomously performing complex tasks. Read more in <a href="/core-concepts/agent-builder.mdx">Core Concepts section</a>

## Agent Builder basics
The most basic concept you should familiarize yourself with when using the AI Agent builder is the way that the automatic Action Graph system works. The Agent Builder screen is split into two parts:

* The **Chat interface** on the left. Use the interface to chat with your Agent so it automatically builds the Action Graph System. Essentially, after selecting Connectors and functions that are _enabled_ in your Agent, prompts in the Chat interface are sent to the Agent Builder, and it in turn builds the Graph System.
* The **Graph System interface** on the right. The Graph System is generated automatically as you chat to your Agent in the Chat interface. Prompts in the Chat interface are sent to the Agent Builder (visually, it is using the Workbench Source Node, see more below) which automatically builds the Action Graph system.

## Agent Builder views
The Agent Builder screen has two modes:
* The **Builder** view is where you build your AI Agent by prompting the Chat interface and automatically constructing the Agent Graph system.
* The **Activity** view is where you can see logs, metrics, traces and analytics about the use of your agent.

## Enabling Operations and Functions for your AI Agent
When building your agent, you configure which Operations (stemming from Connectors) and Functions it is able to execute. You can edit the selection at any time. The selected Operations and Functions are essentially the list of Tools that the Agent will use when running. They also behave as a closed world of tools that the Agent Builder will select from when prompted through the Chat interface.

## Basic steps to start building your AI Agent
Follow these steps to select Operations and Functions, and start building the Agent Graph:

1. In the AI Agents screen, click "Create"
2. In the Agent Builder screen, click the ``+`` button
3. Click the `Connectors & Functions` button
4. Select which Operations and Functions you would like your AI Agent to have access to
<Note>You may first need to *Enable* Connectors from the Connectors screen</Note>
5. Use the Chat interface in the Agent builder to send prompts and start automatically building the Agent Graph system for your AI Agent.

## Graph paths and Prompt groups
In the Agent Graph system, you can create multiple Graph Paths. Each Graph Path has a Prompt Group. Here's a quick explanation of what each of these terms mean:
* Graph paths are a sub-graph of the Graph System that each xpander.ai AI Agent is built around. A Graph Path allows you to create a closed area of incoming prompts to the AI Agents, where the AI Agent will only be able to execute the Operations and Functions within the Graph Path
* Each Graph Path has a Prompt group associated with it. A Prompt group is a list of prompts that you want to build the Graph path around. When the AI Agent is running, every incoming prompt will be matched to one or more prompt groups, and when the AI Agent is performing tool calls when running inside a specific Graph path, it will only be able to execute the Operations and Functions in the same Graph path.
<Tip>Example: You can create a Prompt Group that will contain prompts referring to stock prices. Then, in the sub-graph, make sure that only Operations/Functions relevant to checking stock prices are added. This means that any incoming prompt to the AI Agent that is semnatically similar to the prompts in the *Stock prices* will limit the AI Agent to the Operations/Functions in the same sub-graph</Tip>
