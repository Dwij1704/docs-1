Sources is what makes your xpander-built AI Agent versatile - you can configure sources for chatting to your AI Agent in a Web interface, using it via SDK, chatting with it on Slack and Teams, calling it via Webhook, and more.

Generally, you add Sources to the AGS, and determine which Topics they are connected to. When connecting a Source to a Topic, all prompts flowing from the Source (i.e. from your AI application using the xpander SDK), the AI Application is allowed to traverse Operations in the Topic.
