Source nodes allow you to connect to your AI Agent from external sources (Slack, Teams, Web chat experiences) or to trigger it (via Task automation, API webhooks).

Generally, you can add Source nodes to the graph, and determine which Graph paths they are connected to. When connecting a Source node to a graph path, all prompts flowing from the Source node (i.e. from your AI application using the xpander SDK), the AI Application is allowed to traverse the connected graph path.

## Source node types:

### Workbench

This is the default Source node that represents the Chat interface. By default, it is connected to the default Prompt group in the Graph system. Meaning that any prompt you send in the Agent Builder Chat interface is allowed to traverse the default Graph path.

### SDK

### Chat

### Task

### Webhook

### SaaS Application triggers
