---

All AI agents in xpander are built using our powerful [Agent Graph System](/userguides/core-concepts/agent-graph-system), which automatically generates and manages multi-step workflows. The journey starts in our visual [Agent Builder](/userguides/ai-agent-builder/using-agent-builder) at [app.xpander.ai](https://app.xpander.ai), where you can design and test your agent's behavior.

After designing your agent, you have two deployment options:

1. **Serverless Platform** - Deploy directly from the console using our managed LLMs
2. **SDK with Your Own LLM** - Use the same agent with your preferred LLM deployment

## Start with the Visual Agent Builder

Regardless of your deployment choice, begin by designing your agent in the visual builder:

1. Sign up at [app.xpander.ai](https://app.xpander.ai)
2. Create a new agent using the [Agent Builder](/userguides/ai-agent-builder/using-agent-builder)
3. Design your agent's workflow and test its behavior
4. Choose your deployment option

The Agent Builder provides:
- Visual workflow design
- Automatic [Agent Graph System](/userguides/core-concepts/agent-graph-system) generation
- Real-time testing
- Multiple [Source Nodes](/userguides/core-concepts/source-nodes) (Teams, Slack, WebUI, Webhooks)

## Choose Your Deployment

### Option 1: Serverless Platform
After designing your agent, you can start interacting with it using the serverless platform:

1. Choose your [Source Node](/userguides/core-concepts/source-nodes) (Slack, WebUI, or Webhook)
2. Click "Save" in the Agent Builder
3. Your agent is ready to use!


<Tip>
    You can add a "task" type source node to your agent to schedule its execution. This will automatically inject the specified "prompt" into the agent and initiate its run.
</Tip>


### Option 2: SDK with Your Own LLM
Use the same agent design with your preferred LLM deployment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites">
    1. Install Python 3.8 or higher
    2. Install node.js 18 or higher
    3. xpander account and API key
    4. LLM provider API key (OpenAI/Ollama)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Installation">
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install xpander-sdk openai ollama python-dotenv
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Environment Setup">
    ```env
    XPANDER_API_KEY="your_xpander_key"
    XPANDER_AGENT_ID="your_agent_id"
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"  # If using OpenAI
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Next Steps

Based on your choice:

1. **Begin Your Journey:**
   - Dive into the [visual builder](/userguides/ai-agent-builder/using-agent-builder) to start crafting your AI agent.
   - Discover the power of [agentic interfaces](/userguides/core-concepts/ai-connectors) and the [Agent Graph System](/userguides/core-concepts/agent-graph-system).

2. **Select Your Deployment Strategy:**
   - **Opt for Serverless Platform:**
     - Access [app.xpander.ai](https://app.xpander.ai) to get started.
     - Consult the [Agent Builder guide](/userguides/ai-agent-builder/using-agent-builder) for detailed instructions.
     - Investigate the range of [Source Nodes](/userguides/core-concepts/source-nodes) available.
   - **Opt for SDK Development:**
     - Refer to the [Bring Your Own LLM Guide](/userguides/get-started/bring-your-own-llm) for setup.
     - Understand [SDK Source Nodes](/userguides/core-concepts/source-nodes#sdk-source-nodes) for integration.

3. **Unlock Advanced Capabilities:**
   - Dive into [advanced techniques](/userguides/get-started/advanced-ai-agent-techniques) to enhance your agent's functionality.
