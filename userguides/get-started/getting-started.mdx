All AI agents in xpander are built using our powerful [Agent Graph System](/userguides/core-concepts/agent-graph-system), which automatically generates and manages multi-step workflows. The journey starts in our visual [Agent Builder](/userguides/ai-agent-builder/using-agent-builder) at [app.xpander.ai](https://app.xpander.ai), where you can design and test your agent's behavior.
After designing your agent, you have two deployment options:

1. **Serverless Platform** - Deploy directly from the console using our managed LLMs
2. **SDK with Your Own LLM** - Use the same agent with your preferred LLM deployment

## Start with the Visual Agent Builder

Regardless of your deployment choice, begin by designing your agent in the visual builder:

1. Sign up at [app.xpander.ai](https://app.xpander.ai)
2. Create a new agent using the [Agent Builder](/userguides/ai-agent-builder/using-agent-builder)
3. Design your agent's workflow and test its behavior
4. Choose your deployment option

The Agent Builder provides:

* Visual workflow design
* Automatic [Agent Graph System](/userguides/core-concepts/agent-graph-system) generation
* Real-time testing
* Multiple [Source Nodes](/userguides/core-concepts/source-nodes) (Teams, Slack, WebUI, Webhooks)

## Choose Your Deployment

### Option 1: Serverless Platform

After designing your agent, you can start interacting with it using the serverless platform:

1. Choose your [Source Node](/userguides/core-concepts/source-nodes) (Slack, WebUI, or Webhook)
2. Click "Save" in the Agent Builder
3. Your agent is ready to use!

<Tip>
  You can add a "task" type source node to your agent to schedule its execution. This will automatically inject the specified "prompt" into the agent and initiate its run.
</Tip>

### Option 2: SDK with Your Own LLM 

See full guide here [Bring Your Own LLM](/userguides/get-started/bring-your-own-llm)

<Info>
  For more examples with different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.), check out our [Agents Hub Examples Repository](https://github.com/xpander-ai/xpander-agents-hub/tree/main/agents/examples/model-providers).
