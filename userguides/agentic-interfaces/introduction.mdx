Agentic Interfaces are a new type of API metadata layer, which increases an AI Agent's ability to understand how to execute proper API calls against any target system.

The xpander.ai platform has three types of Agentic Interfaces:

* xpander interfaces: pre-made interfaces with Auth built in, to systems such as Crunchbase, HackerNews, Reddit and others - you don't have to use your own API key or authenticate with Oauth2, you can just start using these interfaces in your AI Agents.

* SaaS interfaces: pre-made interfaces without Auth built in, to systems such as Notion, HubSpot, Google Workspace APIs, Asana and many others. You simply use Oauth2 or your own API key to connect with these interfaces, allowing your AI Agent to instantly use these platforms' APIs.

* Custom interfaces: when you need to connect your AI Agent to a non-SaaS system or not a well-known API, such as your own private, home-grown system, or even your company's digital product. The xpander.ai platform allows you to supply data such as an OpenAPI Spec, Postman collection or even API Reference documentation, and automatically generates and Agentic Interface for you.
