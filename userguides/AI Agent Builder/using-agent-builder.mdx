title: 'Using the AI Agent Builder'
---

The Agent Builder in xpander.ai is a powerful, visual tool that empowers developers to design, configure, and deploy intelligent AI Agents capable of autonomously performing complex tasks. Read more in <a href="/core-concepts/agent-builder.mdx">Core Concepts section</a>

## Agent Builder basics
The most basic concept you should when using the AI Agent builder is the way that the automatic Action Graph system works. The Agent Builder screen is split into two parts:

* The **Chat interface** on the left. Use the interface to chat with your Agent so it automatically builds the Action Graph System. Essentially, after selecting Connectors and functions that are _enabled_ in your Agent, prompts in the Chat interface are sent to the Agent Builder, and it in turn builds the Graph System.
* The **Graph System interface** on the right. The Graph System is generated automatically as you chat to your Agent in the Chat interface. Prompts in the Chat interface are sent to the Agent Builder (visually, it is using the Workbench Source Node, see more below) which automatically builds the Action Graph system.
